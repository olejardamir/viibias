My people will annihilate yours!
I stipulate only that my own life be spared!
* * * * * Voicelessly the word went forth: Slay!
Then the bomb fell and exploded.
This has thrown your civilization out of balance.
You use talc mostly for toilet purposes.
You have no superiors in your line.
Drop out of life on this planet.
For the love of God bring on the net!
I would not have done that to Dean
Masquerading now as her brother.
Johnson offered to try and capture you.
By the Gods, I warn you I can check up on you!
I added, You think you are clever.
There is plenty you don't know.
Gregg, if they are listening-- I pushed her away.
Anita would arm herself, and come and release me.
By God, this Haljan is with us!
You'll be rich like us all, never fear.
Gregg, we must get you back to your cubby!
George Prince has no business here with me!
I fired my paralyzing cylinder through my cloak.
I beat his skull with the metal of my cylinder.
Miko was struggling with Anita.
I flung the useless cylinder at them.
Do you think I am such a child you can escape me!
She said, Leave me with him, Miko....
There will be fighting with Grantline.
You're a strange fellow, Haljan.
He held his huge fist before my face.
With these fingers I will twist your neck!
And in Ferrok-Shahn, others, no doubt.
That miserable mouselike creature!
I think you will cause no more trouble, Gregg?
These weird amateur navigators!
Venza's swift words back there in the lounge.
By the Almighty, Moa, are you up there?
Moa's knife could have stabbed me.
Here, get out of my way, all of you!
But you have me to deal with now.
Miko gigantic--a great, menacing ogre.
Abruptly Miko strode at me from across the room.
Anita spoke in a careful, throaty drawl.
My accursed, witless incapacity!
Unmasked the waxen art of Glutz.
So, little Anita, you are given back to me.
A million million rills were here.
Grotesque, bloated semblance of a man!
We all know it's infernal doing nothing.
Unreasonable, ominous depression!
Excitement and pleasure swept the room.
You'll bulge out our walls, Commander.
Moa watched me and Snap, a grim, cold Amazon.
It's the girl, masquerading as her brother.
We will watch him, little Anita.
Miko muttered, That accursed Hahn.
He stood over them with menacing weapon.
Her arms went around me, and I lifted her.
Anita, we must get out of here!
She shuddered and turned away and gripped me.
Did you think I wanted you with my dying breath?
The lights on her were extinguished.
Were her eyes going back on her?
But Allen, you must listen, listen carefully.
The director under your tongue.
It's really none of your business.
* * * * * Opthalmia be sugared!
What are you doing--pulling my leg?
Oh, ye wud, wud yer, little mann?
Finery, haughtiness do not entice me.
Today a proud Rome claims to be queen of the world.
Often will she turn up, ever in a new form.
Falconier ogled me often enough.
Here I stand in the end being cheated and scolded.
You don't believe your own words.
Oh come now, admit what I am saying is true.
I am wont to obey, when my commander decrees.
XVI Boy, won't you light me a lamp.
Wretched young fellow, be gone and obey me!
Boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold.
Go seek other realms beneath heaven.
I haven't escaped her, the goddess.
She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!
Here, perhaps, is a post for poor Mr. MASTERMAN.

I don't mean that he lives by sculping.
Why, you're not doing my mouth yet, I urged.
You've never had anything in yet, have you?
There's such a lot of rotten vanity knocking about.
You can't be such a bad subject after all.
COUSIN HUGH straightway blocked it by a bogus Bill.
You've got to stay where you are till you die.
Don't, with a superior air, be silly, Dan.
Have you got a knife in your pocket, Dan?
I have already written to your aunt.
You are always rubbing the servants the wrong way.
I don't take any notice of her.
It do seem like it, she groaned.
You don't fink he is hurt, do you, Kitty?
You don't fink Dan has been struck, do you?
It's only me they are down on, really.
Look at my nose, miss, he said meaningly.
I know
Yes, I know; but you only pretend.
She had had much success with girls.
And I'll beat her too, snapped Betty.
Why doesn't Aunt Pike teach her better?
They won't scratch us then, will they?
I only pities em if they ain't Demshur.
I am sure you must be quite exhausted.
I have been such a--such a fool
Bad people would be afraid to come.
No, I don't believe it, she snapped.
I love it, she exclaimed with a sigh of pleasure.
Now be quiet, Pamela, while I make my list.
You see, he knows so many poor people.
You see, I can always send for your aunt.
I don't think she looked so last term.
Then you set this on fire on purpose!
I wonder you aren't afraid to be so wicked!
Poor child, I will take you to your room.
You ain't feeling bad, are you?

Huxley says, For every vital act, life is used up.
You cannot think, because you cannot fully breathe.
This is true even of the most ignorant or degraded.
And here let me give you a word of warning.
The results of self-abuse are most disastrous.
If she is prudish she won't get any attention.

Sech bleeding eyes--an nose, hey?

Trunnell appeared to sniff sarcasm.
Jest sort o smelly like fer new junk.
Yes, sir, the faultfinder is always a failure.
Why is Mr. Trunnell like a lady's bouquet, hey?
It's because he's a daisy, rapped out the skipper.
That's it, Mr. Rolling, he's a daisy, ha, ha, ha!
Is that it, you square-toed, lantern-jawed swab?
Don't pull a pound on the bleeding line.
Did you ever see such a lot o confounded fools?
Shall I get yo drink fust, sah?
Don't make a fool of yourself before these men.
She'll go off soon, yelled the mate in my ear.
Oh, it isn't so bad the way she's taking it now.
Yessah, dey is dat. Hab a leetle nip fore yo goes?
This time you expected just right, Trunnell.
We've got a big enough load already.
Then I slid it back, and entered.
The stuffy little box was full of men.
Bile em, white man, said the cook.
Yah, yah, Mr. Chips, but you beats me.
Yes, sah, you beats me, but yer haid is thick.

His face turned purple with rage.
You follow this lay, don't you?
Jest think of a stomach full o warts.
I can just make out her mastheads.
Oh, no, said the ruffian, I intend to stay.
Big head, nothin in it, as the sayin is.
Every word you say is mutinous.
Shake out the bunt of yer breeches and come here.
Then he'd grab me and yank me acrost his knee.
asked the fellow, with a smirk.
You must do this or you will be insubordinate.
All we did was to defend ourselves.
Will you surrender and put down your knives?
Don't let Dalton get forward alive.
Only get off before it's too late.
What made you come with us, you rogue?
You shall not go back for them!

I will when he gets off a good joke, mother.
You couldn't rise to the occasion like your mamma.
I say, Rolling, what the deuce are you two doing?
What makes the top of your mast so black, hey?
So here I am, all in a mess wid that little mate.
Give way, bullies, you're going to sleep.
That's it, boys, give it to her.

Go along, ye lucky dog, he cried.
Her hand closed upon mine behind the backboard.
Now it will be, Come, ducky, come and be cooked.
Do you know her engagement's off?
Is that all you called me in for?
I heard enough of that last night.
I'm not there and never will be.
You don't know what a good time means.
You know big men never run after you.
Come, ducky, come and be cooked!
It's easy as rolling off a log to manage a woman.
Mr. Loveland, you _exhaust_ me!
Then I will teach you that I also can be firm.
Steve gardens, and you know it.
You haven't any wife or daughter.
That's why they're bothering us so?

She don't say much, but she looks it.
Why, you don't look any too well.
DeLancy is insane by this time, I know!
Hilda, you sit still and cool off!
You've just been in a stew ever since you came.
I'll never hear the last of this as long as I live!
Now you follow him, and be off--both of you!
I don't care if they get as cold as an iceberg!
You treat me as if I were a two-year-old child!
Bridget, she said, can you milk?
No more wud I, an he's stud it so long.
You're all of you as mean as you can be!
No more you needn't, me darlint!
Steve has left her right out here.
She didn't even look toward you.
That's what makes Lillie higher than you.
Oh, he was an odious old thing!

Sure a big dose of bees will be good fer her.
Shure it's the divil himsilf broke loose!
There, now, come, Mr. Loveland--she's off!
Ef she'll hitch on I could, he say.
Shure she was in that last beefsteak I ate.
She said he was mean enough to do anything.
Oh, I can't stand it no longer.
she blazed, and you're a contemptible brute!
I wonder you aren't ashamed to be alive!
You're using the poker too freely.
You didn't think much of her at one time, did you?

CHAPTER IV LOOK OUT FOR MY RIVAL!
I don't suppose you mind a fight or two
He's sure to make trouble if he gets on your trail.
We ain't goin neah de Amerzon riber at all.
well, the less said about them the better.
I'm going to giant land, fight or no fight!
I guess we won't be bothered with him.
You won't have to worry about him.
You'll have no trouble I guess.
Don't tell everyone our business, Rad.
I'll keep mighty still bout it.
Maybe he's a gambler in disguise.
I'll put on some other disguise!
Plenty much, sometimes too many they come.
Make them so they can't join the others!
Yo'-all am too much excited bout him.
Come on here, you obstinate brute!
That's a big boa constrictor that has Mr. Damon!
San Pedro, and the other natives, could do nothing.
Put me down, boys, I guess I can walk.
There's a native war going on around here.
Small charges, just to stun them!
Ask him where the giant men live?
Rad, you go stand guard over our stuff.
There's a man here as big as a mountain.
Please good Mr. Angel-- Dry up, Rad!
Then why not with human beings?
You're one of the royal family now, Tom.
He was that fake minister on the boat.
But I guess they are too gentle to fight.
If they attack us we will have to defend ourselves.
Is that possible to any of you giants?
I guess they're going to besiege us.
You're too weak to do much, replied Tom.
Let em go right in their faces!
Him too old, and he motioned to Eradicate.
I never heard of such a thing in all my life!
121 X A Night With the Indians.
Big Pete isn't doing that for fun!
And they want me to finish the job do they?
The nags Big Pete had was really runnin away.
And what of that burly giant, by the way?
Ye air takin long chances, boys, I do tell ye.
There is little future for a young man here.
Haunted by Redcoat spies, I guess, Ree answered.
John kicked Ree's shins under the table.
I just had in mind puttin a flea in your ear.
You are almost too big for your breeches!
I am going to skirmish for the rascal!
Just you keep your breeches on!
His cold hand on my bare skin waked me up.
It looks consarned strange, that's what I say!
The boys slept with one eye open that night.
Go long way off and never mind.
You are thinking of Big Pete
Don't sell the nag, then; come right along with me.
The Scalp at Big Buffalo's Belt.
Got a little muscle, too, ain't ye?
Oh, these here boys are frisky!
If Big Buffalo had a dared, he'd a pitched onto us.
It ain't your'n, kitten, an ye can be glad o that.
I see all that--I ain't so blind!
That Buffalo varmint means harm.
Did ye hit him, d'ye think, Ree?
It is fer me to squar accounts--an I'll--do it.
Has the Big Buffalo cause to be unfriendly?
Other Palefaces are crowding further and further.
You've been making love behind my back, have you?
RECONNOITRING COURGIVAULT 76 IV.
We are only here to take care of the train.
You are soldiers, like the others....
Why have you let them come into our country?
I'm sure you don't know what fear is!
and not in the right direction!
I put the muzzle of my revolver into his ear.
Two explosions about 300 yards in front of us!
Your country relies upon you to stop them.
No, you couldn't treat us so cruelly.
and we give it to our poor old people on festivals.
Sister Gabrielle, you are an angel from Paradise.
But, one thing, we shall sleep like tops.
glorious legacy of our ancestors!
Suddenly a cold breath of air blew into my retreat.
Now the blast summoning me is sounded.
I took your mother's place as best I could.
then shall they drink freely of their own gore!
From giants ye have become pigmies!
This time his tone was calm, stagnant as despair.
She is not here: that is enough for you to know.
I don't care for your master and mistress.
Desperate positions require desperate measures.
The nurse stood at the door, defiant.
A great brown man with a beard.
Maybe, she is gone for the police?
I believe there's a curse on you.
I'll leave that poor Ailsie, too.
If you don't send for the police, I shall.
My mind misgave me when I heard he never came in.
But you found your mistake, didn't you?
What is your terrible hurry, mee deer?
If I tell you, ma'am, you won't tell missis?
You have been a mortal long time!
Why, your witness to be sure, ma'am.
But be considerate, I beg ee, mee deer.
I am bitterly punished--I am, I am!
I never care what anyone else does.
They say that he is secretly married.
Men understand women so little.
Well, go and drink his champagne.
for _GOD'S_ sake, help my children and me.
Help your mother's friend, your own old friend.
She dropped the letter into the fire.
That's what I do, and it's why I'm so wretched.
Only I'll tell you what I'll do.
But you will--that is you would.
Quite sure I'm a beastly duffer?
Are you really sure my mother doesn't know?
Of your mother, I say--_always_.
Your ears shall tingle, I can tell you.
Never was there a more unjust war.
Christian Herwig died in abject misery.
His head remained for many years exposed on a pike.
They cut off his nose flush with his face.
I shut it up and went to my meal.
Italians are not of much account.
Kicks instead of pay, they said.
They pointed to the men that had been executed.
We shall soon settle your account.
Wait till you are told to go and then go.
Take it, go, and leave me in peace.
They brought the emperor a corpse.
May the lightning blast him, and so forth.
Dear Bastian, replied Boineburg, May God help you.
Go wherever you like, she snarled.
May the devil take you and them.
There was a great loss of life and property.
Hide thy head with shame, vile hypocrite!
And I have accomplished all this with my pen.
Have you not got your paunch to fill?
May all the evils of Job befall thee.
Maltzan turned a deaf ear to all my requests.
As a matter of course, he was not very matutinal.
I beg to submit that this man be strictly watched.
And clapped into gaol if necessary, I retorted.
What he has got is simply ridiculous.
Immediately, as usual, the Jews were accused of it.
I forbid the bans, for one, cried Trevanion.
N'importe--then we'll fight at a barriere.
Come let us see what vein you are in.
Bring him down, and I'll die easy.
But, tell me fairly, am I a good Pole?
Sure, if I'm a Pole, that's enough of misfortune.
But she is a disagreeable creeter, and no mistake.
And no human bein wuz ever known to suit her.

This is no exaggerated picture.
Let Owen Connor, behyind you, give it, acushla!
I'll lave him now, and go be a sodger.
What's the matter wid yourself, Owen?
sit down, avich, and taste this.
Yes, Patsy, said Owen, kissing him, your own Nony!
I've got the sickness, and am going fast.
This is a cowld damp place for you, my boy.
The heavens be his bed this night!
don't say them words, and I laving you for ever.
Don't you hear, my good fellow?
Tis a thrue one, as sure as I live in sin.
So that's what you'd be at, my boy, is it?
said Heffernan, with a sneering accent.
Ould Heffernan, divil fear him!
Milton was a Puritan, Keats a neo-pagan.
And what does that proud injured Ajax reply?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is it not one of alarm and disgust?
O Life, as futile, then, as frail!
What if it be stagnant and slimy here?
I did no think; gi me my supper, woman.
They're bad enough, that's true.
What a flesh-tint the stuff has!
Summat to make her live, I think,--like you.
May, he broke out impatiently, are you blind?
So many nerves to sting them to pain.
Not I, I tell you, said Kirby, testily.
Things go harder Wi you nor me.
It's only poor Deb,--hur knows?
Never saw a man so cut down in my life.
These mill-hands are gettin onbearable.
It acts different on em, bein sentenced.
Most of em gets reckless, devilish-like.
That woman, now, she's desper't.
dunnot look at me, when it wur my fault!
broke out Haley, pushing her before him.
It was good to see a face like that.
Granny Hill the boys called her.
Did hur know my boy wud like it?
Give us our one, precious, solitary eye!
You have two of your own Give us our eye!
I am by no means a bad young man.
Don't let them make a fool of you!
But, if I cannot see you, neither can the Gorgons.
The sight would turn you to stone!
This instant, repeated Polydectes, or you die!
The young fool shall make apology!
clucked Trenchard, irrepressible.
Richard threw his wine in Mr. Wilding's face?
I would not have Richard a coward.
It will tell you what a palsied thing you are.
A cane would be the weapon he'd use on you.
The only truth is that Richard is afraid.
Were I in your place, I'd straight to Wilding.
But you are in no case to stand!
Is this a time for trafficking with doxies?
I bring you worship, and you answer me with scorn.
He paused, the rope in his, his eye kindling anew.
He'll be stiff as a broom-handle--an easy victim.
quoth he, you are in no case to fight.
S a scurvy trick I'm playing the Duke.
S treason to him--treason no less.
Could I wed the sister having slain the brother?
snapped Blake before she could reply.
But at least you shall not be sacrificed.
And if I were to say that it is white?
In time, I swear, you shall not think it.
Give it me, he bade her, waxing fierce.
Let me know more, he begged her.
I'll sli throat of any man t says so.
Are ye sure ye're norrer foul traitor?
Are y sure, for if ye're not...
Down with Popery, and God save the Protestant Duke!
Have I sat at table with a traitor?
Are you capable of such a baseness?
Are you as stubborn as your friend?
By God, sir, you are a daring rogue!
Of course not, said Albemarle with heavy sarcasm.
He's not even an ingenious liar.
You're but an indifferent liar.
What an impudent rogue have we here!
You give me credit for no more wit than yourself.
Aye, you may stare, sneered Trenchard.
I'll allow no brother of hers to hang in my place.
Slife I'll make an example of you.
Are we to listen to this milksop prattle?
There will be no second coming for you.
Men will not trust you another time.
The Cause is good
For my own, sir; for my own I would have you know.
Yet the egregious fool went on.
Not looked to do so, Your Gr...
You have a rare effrontery, sir--aye, by God!
Do you dare call Danvers a coward?
I'll not endure it from this knave!
We are not pleased with you, Mr. Wilding.
suggested Ferguson at that moment.
An insolent, overbearing knave!
See what it is to serve a weakling.
said he
You have nothing but mockery for me.
Never bear an old man malice, lad, said he.
Shalt urge me no excuses, or we'll quarrel.
cried Richard, his eyes blazing, his lips livid.
Now, what a plague is't you're saying?
He moistened his lips with his tongue.
Or die like the muckworm that you are.
he asked with a sudden increase of fierceness.
Because that craven villain there betrayed me.
Why were they not abed like all decent folk?
You t'ought t'at be to do your duty, eh?
Natural you will not speak true.
A traitor I ave observe is always liar.
Your lordship is pleased to account me a traitor?
Feversham scowled at him, smiling darkly.
More I dare not give you, as you can see.
Nay, nay, little child, he whispered in her ear.
I'm an attainted outlaw, Walters, he explained.
Ask his craven, numskulled lordship.
Do you keep a fool's egg under that nest of hair?
Sir Rowland, said he, you're a knave.
quoth Trenchard, understanding less and less.
Have you turned Mussulman, perchance?
Your brother must have been helping us.
Both are nearly twice the size of your own.
But, lad, never forget that you are English.
English boys play with all their might.
Why, he has a wrist like iron, this cousin of mine.
No, Pierre; the men will look after him, as usual.
Soldiers are generally bad cooks.
The rest of you stay here, and guard these lackeys.
What does this mean, you rascals?
I am a Huguenot officer, and you are my prisoner.
Now it is your turn to be a prisoner.
His innocent wife was also dragged away with him.
These gentlemen have been sufficiently humiliated.
The king has come to regard us as enemies.
Shall we ring the alarm bell, mother?
All Guyenne swarms with her enemies.
Now, good luck to you, Master Philip.
You are a Gascon, by your tongue?
You will find me in or near Cognac.
No, Jacques, it would be worse in every way.
These pestilent Huguenots are everywhere.
These Huguenots seem to spring out of the ground.
He has challenged me to fight, and fight he shall.
I have often climbed to its top, when I was a boy.
That is where the fighting will be.
What on earth do you want to skin them for, Philip?
The smoke told you what to expect, he said.
Halt and declare yourselves, or we fire.
Most of the others were taken prisoners.
There are plenty of young Frenchmen, prince.
The King of France has no children.
Even now, the persecutors may be on our track.
There are Huguenots, and Huguenots.
Not the least in the world, Francois.
Then, monsieur, fighting would not avail you.

As for the rest of us, we are furious.
This is not the time for pleasure.
You are dreaming, Monsieur Fletcher.
Still, if you wish it, we can die here together.

Philip's pent-up rage found a vent.
You have eaten no food the last two days.
The young count is not like you, monsieur.
If not, he must be in hiding somewhere.
They will return and finish me.

Sufficient for their day was the evil thereof.
They did not even deign a response.

The demand is only adding insult to injury.
Very respectfully yours, Jefferson Davis.
I am, as ever, your friend, Jefferson Davis.
And for what end, sir, is all this aggression?
We will not permit aggressions.
You have made it a political war.
They oppressed opposite religions.

The act is perfectly justified by me.

Here in Korea, you're known already.
I spent a lot of time spying on them.
He squinted at me, bared his fine teeth.
Give a liar enough rope and he'll trip himself.
If it's like you say it is, there'll be more.
Then in the night my four Koreans deserted.
The four of us might be able to handle her people.
Her clothing was like nothing on this earth.
Her skin was whiter than my own!
I would not, that is why he hurt me.
Why did you come back, whatever-your-name?
Leave these others, and you will live!
Stay with them, you will be slain with them.
What kind of man do you think me?
When I got back to camp, Hank had a girl.
He'd thrown her down, was struggling with her.
Didn't want trouble with her people.
Some girl, wearing this kind of stuff!
I stood up, took out my pipe and filled it.
I turned my face away, shuddering.
Why do your people take my companions?
You did not see, whatever-your-name-is....
This is not your kind of country.
You don't really want me to go, Nokomee.
Go, I cannot protect you from this place.
What is a Zoorph, that makes you so angry?
When men are tired of life, they go to a Zoorph.
But he is wrong, they will never come.
I have a life to live, I want to _live_ it!
Perhaps she could do what she said.
These things had _never_ been men.
That is for the public
I came purely to get gold and for no other reason.
What is it you find so revolting about us.
That would not happen to any but enemies.
We did not come here to colonize, earthman.
I would save your people as well as myself.
They are our priests and our administrators.
Because I can be useful to her when she attacks us.
With you will go my brother, Genner.
It was torn now and even more revealing.
You are a cruel, and a spineless creature.
I despise you, and yet I want you very much.
Her voice became low and penetrating.
You will be two, yet alone, above the all.
Never mind
We will see that you do not, sweet Carna.
It must be hereditary, such power!
You must not be seen making the injection.
I can send more ships manned with my men, later.
Keep going, and conceal yourselves in the bush.
I will guide the search away from you.
The Jivros know our location now.
Now, she's gone, I don't even know the dosage.
Their power is ending this night!
I raised my head and kept on firing.
They are fighting only for life!
Carna will have to perish with it.
I dropped to the roof surface with agony.
I stumbled over the reeking heap of slain.
and then his head dropped lifeless.
This is madness, woman, we must get out of here.
I tugged out the .45 at my belt, leveled it, fired.
I fell forward into blackness....
You are ridiculous, old insect!
They expected to conquer earth, Carna.
This is the beginning of their end!
That is why the Zoorphs are hated, earthman.
We are polygamous, and not apt to be jealous.
There are only baby whitebaits.
Stephanie was caught too and became a sardine.
It ain't no good denyin it, cos I took the number.

Men snoring, Paolo whispered in his ear.
That is right, but wait until I call an officer.
There he lies under his cloak, general.
No, sir, I am not such a fool as that.
Now we will keep you no longer from your couch.
He is the most insensible of men.
And are you going to leave the army, monsieur?
They will be countrymen, but no longer comrades.
Now the sooner you get down there the better.
He is a married man with a helpful little wife.
Now, sir, we will keep you here no longer.
And could you do nothing for them, monsieur?

I speak loud because I have right on my side.
Now I don't like that, Colonel Campbell.

It is his soul which so fascinates women.
That undersized sphynx of a Villefort?
She will die if there is not a change.
Is it true that you are so weak as all that?
Does it not move you to indignation?
I might say haggard, if it was polite.
You are as colorless as marble.
I must tell you, or I shall die.
I am not the bad woman you think me.
I did not die, as I had intended.

It's that conceited jackanapes of his--Frank Frost.
Dunno what'll become of poor Pomp when I'se gone.
Pears like me and Pomp must starve.
What did you do that for, Pomp?
I ain't got noffin for you, said Pomp defiantly.
For the lub of Heaven, lef me be.
If you say much more, I'll flog you too!
I care more about whipping you, a cursed sight!
Brutality isn't respectable here, my lad.
It seems to me he's been making a catspaw of you.
It isn't good for boys like you and me.
I won't mention that I have seen you.
Then you ain't going to stop there?
He was destined to receive a summary castigation.
She didn't feel quite right inside.
I touched him up a little, he said.
You ain't robbin yourself, be you?

You're the largest man living in the world.
I don't think you know your lesson, Pomp.
What are you doing there, Pomp?
Spec she must have tied herself.
Come, Pomp, you know better than that.
Get up immediately and unfasten her.
And what did you do to her, Pomp?
I don't think you always tell the truth, Pomp.
Spec I've got a little debble inside of me.
What makes you tell so many lies?

There's some wild crittur down there.
So it's you, you little varmint, that's done this.
You can't get out, missus; yah, yah!

It is a heartless trick, Mr. Townshend.
Then she turned to me fiercely.
I blame his enemies and his miserable destiny.
I went back in a hurry to the Americans.
Mr. Cargill, do you realise what you are saying?
You are forgetting the principles of a lifetime.
Cargill has been incredibly and infamously silly.
Your friends know that it is a gross libel.
We must get rid of this ridiculous Radical tail.
I tell you it is rank nonsense.

They threw him on the floor in a room upstairs.
For they are going to hang him.
Or, worst of all, what had the enemy done to him?
Take him back to my quarters, he finally answered.
He acts as if the Allies were a lot of children.
They can't stand before our bayonets.
And we'll end it in the streets of Berlin!
They're coming like a swarm of locusts.
And there's millions more where they came from.
Don't kid yourself, replied Frank grimly.
The Americans were standing like a rock.
And Heinie was going to walk all over us, was he?
I suppose our commanders know what they're doing.

Boys, we didn't guess wrong that day.
The girl says that Tom was bound with ropes.
The bridge now was black with Germans.
But be careful, for the Germans are all around us.
You're the most contemptible thing that breathes.
Where do you expect to get them, on your head?
I'm ashamed now to look a fish in the face.
I wouldn't have done a thing to him!
He doesn't want any of your game.
Of course we're going to lick them.
Tom, old man, you've missed some lovely fighting.
I wish He was your grandpa too!
My dear friend, clear your mind of cant....
THE PRECISIAN AT WAR WITH THE WORLD IV.
Oh, I forgot you two were silly old Socialists.
They were like that
Their tastes, habits, outlook, and mental diseases.
for letting other people alone....
Facts are too difficult, too complicated for him.
She knew she was badly, incredibly left.
Why don't you join up as a combatant?
Only they were getting common
They have the unthinking rightness of the fool.
He's not a bad young thing, do you think.
He's forgetting because I don't get a chance....
She cares for nothing but herself....
Peggy says men don't like them, but they do.
They don't bother, but they get what they want....
I hate red-flaggery, and all other flaggery.
I can hear dear old Peter Clancy on why he died.
Why go groping for far-fetched reason?
She's been and gone and done it.
Jane is imperilling her immortal soul.
You might as well try and stop a young tank.
Feminine and all that, you know.
But I don't want to discuss Bolshevism here.
I wash my hands of the lot of you.
She doesn't know what it's like to be a Jew.
The children of Israel are his speciality.
Your mother told me where you'd gone.
But it would be a little too indecent.
I felt hard and rather sore that evening.
You'd better spit it out, Jukie.
You mayn't know it, but you are.
Go to bed yourself, you need rest.
I took her in my arms and gave her a long kiss.
You can put that in the papers, daddy.
My pet, of course you can't, and you shan't.
My dearest child, you must wait for me.
So that dreadful Jew must have gone.
Rotten bad luck, poor old chap.
Laid like a stone, she did, as white as milk.
Don't bolt and bar the Door....
Naturally, I replied very coolly.
You'll say it's not my business.
First, I must save my child from this awful man.
Besides, he might only laugh at me.
He is talking to a tall dark man.
The dark man strikes the fair man....
The dark man is left standing alone....
Nasty stairs
And she was knocked over by his beauty.
You want me to mix a poison for Lady P?
she asked me casually, lighting another cigarette.
They aren't part of her equipment.
It's this beastly baby, I suppose....
I got sick of it during the war.
She said, Of course They hate us.
Oh, it's all pretty sickening, isn't it?
It has never damaged any one but myself.
It must have been pretty bad for her.
No, because they are already that.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, and you know the rest....
No one need ever know but your parents and myself.
You've got to tell the truth....
I'm not going to repeat the things I said.
But it will still be there--the awful thing I did.
And, after all, a foolish one to ask.
I saw that she was all tense and strung up.
Poor mother doesn't know what to make of it.
If he is guilty, it is due to the public.
You don't know what you are saying.
_Did_ you knock Oliver down that night?
Yes, he said, still staring at her.
Didn't you fight shy of me, then?
She resumed, And Jewish babies!
She'd have suited him much better.
Gideon and his sort haven't got the goods.
He doesn't like mother, and she doesn't like him.
Jewish babies
You wouldn't like that, you know....
I haven't a message, like mother.
No. There's no such thing as a truce with them.
I don't like them round, either.
You only want intelligence and exact knowledge.
You're going crazy on that subject.
Oh, Arthur, it is rot, your chucking it.
Why do girls like washing babies?
Dreadful fellows
You're giving up the fight, then.
This thing's too strong for me to fight.
Things do matter, said the Russian Jew.
So given over to muddle and lies.
Won't the Reds get you, or the Whites?
Only one can't, to kids; they're too important.
You'll come back worse than ever, my dear....
Clever, cringing, nerve-ridden people, he said.
That's Russian, not Jewish specially.
then found by Bolshevists and disposed of ...
And gypsies are also found there, are they not?
You even still travel through the wreck!
You would make your fortune with her!
The Saviour was severe, severe as He must be!
Not ONE innocent soul have I poisoned!
in my hands it makes a fool of me.
Lay down the clothes, and retire!
And no friend, not a single one!
You are the sister of little Jonas!
She is beautiful, very beautiful!
You shall sleep in the black chamber!
No, the deuce remain a night with you!
Only a weak attempt to imitate my sister!
whispered Otto: they all look like crazy people.
It is truly hard to be born such a being!
Yes, you have always been a little foolish!
said Wilhelm
Only do not let Nature play her freaks with you!
That is their joy, their happiness!
Let him sleep the eternal rest!
Strengthen yourself now with meat and drink!
for no doubt she must be from a town!
Do you not believe in the power of the devil?
You will not make me suffer for it!
After all, she really knows nothing!
This Heinrich is my evil angel!
I will hence--here will my life-germ be stifled!
Yes, you young men talk according to your wisdom!
You might wish yourself such a chest!
You are going to Roeskelde, are you not?
[Note: We are the lords of the kingdom of mind!
We are the stem which can never decay!
He sees you in the club sometimes.
There you were playing the martyr!
You make the poor girl miserable!
The more development of mind, the more ancestors!
There are many things for which you have a bad ear!
That is like the people abroad!
Your old friends interest you no longer!
You have better places to go to!
I sink, and shall never return!
That is the most foolish thing a person can do!
But we allow too many people to travel!
You quite forget your true friends!
There, our Saviour looks down upon us!
We shall immediately put you under arrest.
Will you not take the Kammerjunker's sister?
This violent love cannot be evaporated.
You may make yourself easy, if you are jealous!
Only two months longer shall I remain in Denmark!
His physical amiability melts into the spiritual.
He loves Eva, and that is very unfortunate.
Bring haeusliche Huelfe Incubus!
Thy evil conscience has condemned thee.
Confess, or it will go worse with thee!
Release me from this anxiety which overpowers me!
Yet, the good gentleman must not get angry!
They dislike her, every one of them.
She was the repelled one, the rejected one!
I shall destroy myself if you betray me!
We will thank God that we are well rid of her!
she will come to an unfortunate end!
Not one of her features resembles yours.
I am more unfortunate than you can believe.
Denmark's wisest and dearest king!
I will find out my real sister!
I will have proof in hand of the truth!
I have been made Heinrich's plaything--his tool!
Now he ridicules me, and I am compelled to bear it!
now I say, To-day, and all day long!
My eternal Saviour knows that I have never stolen!
My mother was so too--my poor mother!
and where did you, poor children, remain?
and Otto will no longer suffer and be unhappy!
He is an odd person, as you very well know!

STATEMENTS ON THE WAR IN EUROPE.
War is an international nuisance.
He is not a man of culture, nor of reading.
At Shavli we took 500 prisoners.
The allied troops there are attacking.
North of Przasnysz another 150 prisoners were made.
Forward, fair France's children!
And yet the French are called a frivolous people!
The Turkish casualties were heavy.
The Turkish offensive has sensibly weakened.

Last night the joy lasted a long while.
There it lay, there it slept like a rat.
The wireless operators said: Thank God!
That lay swarming full of Englishmen.
Now the Arabs began to help us.
In the night, Lieutenant Schmidt died.
Violence has no reserves but further violence.
Let us abolish the noncombatant and the neutral.
There are no terms and no retreat in this war.
People said: They _are_ Germany!
It is Germany's terrible and sinister function.
I'll stand and fight
Great God, they're coming fast-- Are almost on me!
War must be ruthless, must be frightful.
And even then she is not logical.
An officer and gentleman may not lie.
We used to slaughter the entire population.
War finishes nothing, it only interrupts.
You are ready to die for your faith.
We agreed it was our job to knock one another out.
Nothing, he said, was more incorrect.
Your hand is trembling, your lips are pale!
Ere Bill, listen to wot this ere cry-baby says.
There were wounded officers present.
Every time he utters it he is helping the enemy.
Then, in a fierce roar of denial, No!
America is fighting for America.
You're fighting for yourselves, they said.
They were getting beyond her control.
The slaughter is still a nice little war.
With the French it is a martyrdom.
But with the Americans it is a job.
She was attacked
And lastly, What infernal impertinence!
War is a business, the Germans have said.
I turned to my American soldier.
Girls are very much in evidence.
The only boys were of the mal-nourished variety.
The Americans see to the children.
Lazaruses--that's what they are!

That is exactly what they are doing.

Then why the devil did he speak like that?

You would never think, would you?
Now you know everything, and it is much better.
That indeed would be a little too shameless.
No doubt your country medico is a duffer.

Why, you must be crazy, my girl!

Of course not, she replied coldly.
She'd be just an old glove kicking around.
Don't bother, I said, I'm safe.

He looked me up and down deliberately.

You all think I'm hard and heartless.
But what is she doing down there?
She isn't an inexperienced young girl.
You are not hard, you are not heartless.

You are not changeable and vacillating.

I could not go back with self-respect.
I doubt if I would be experienced enough for you.
You are young to fear parasitism, Miss Vars.
She touched it, folded, to her nose.
We might try each other anyway.
I wondered sometimes if she felt any.
What have you to say to that, Miss Enthusiast?
I had no idea you were such a little enthusiast.
You're so swift and quiet with cups.

It was black, so were her eyes.

You, first, Signor, then the others here.
I did not kiss him--never, never, never!
And what will your mother think?
This man ought to know what he was talking about.
And you can tell about your policeman friend, too.
Now you can spend the day in doing what you please.
That feller's too slick for us.
He's proved it many a time before.
Why are you packing your knapsack!
Sure, I ain't had so good a boy since.
Come, ittle snow-sister, kiss me!
But, mamma, her hand is, oh, so very cold!
Pray, what little girl may that be?

A good story is just what I want this vile mornin.
Bit hairy about the heels, of course.
You'll no get her to stop here.
I don't care a docken about the law.
It would break his heart, poor man.
We riped your pooches lang syne.
You're a very desperate little chap.
A Bolshevik and an awful bad lot.
You're terribly behind the fair.
Away with you, man, and never mind me.
You can sit behind me and hang on to my waist.
He aye said you were an Australian....
Yon Sir Erchibald has poor notions o strawtegy.
Trade will be gettin brisk with him.
You can go to the devil, said Heritage.
Let them bark up another wrong un.
I'm ower wise to argy-bargy wi women.
Ye're makin as much noise as a road-roller.
Now you listen to your instructions.
Cold, cheerless, raw monstrosity!
Pray God your police come soon.
You there, he cried, looking up, you English.
Come on, lads, if ye're no besotted on destruction.
We maun be up and daein oorsels.
I wouldna wonder but the place is on fire.
They're no here yet, but they're comin.
The Gorbals Die-Hards had gone into action.
God be thankit, is't the polis?
Nor did all the Russians perish.
You will not find him in Russia.
I'm a better man for it, Dogson.
I've just the one thing to say to you.
From now on you're _my_ bairns, every one of you.
And everything that comfortable.
What have you been doing to your head?
He's or'narily sitch a cool, unexcitable man.
The Blackfeet are too strong for us.
Manitou thinks it time for me to die.
She'll niver be able to stand it.
His words are hidden from his Indian friend.

Now, you'll be careful, soft one?
Stan still; I vill strik light, said Softswan.
Big Tim says hims fadder be great at ventions.
Not being particular, he tried it with his tongue.
Experience teaches bears as well as fools.
You tasted my toes this mornin.
Come, come along; have another taste of my toe!
THE SNAKES MAKE A DART AND SECURE THEIR VICTIMS.
Is he not the enemy of my tribe?
Bounding Bull never taught that to _me_.
THE POWERFUL INFLUENCE OF BAD WEAPONS AND OF LOVE.
Does he ever kick his little squaw?
If you go you will surely die, my son.
He is not a squaw--at least, not a skipping one.
Fortunately, her face could not be seen.
She's a heady little lady, if you want to know.
You're the most beautiful woman in all this world!
And a lot I'd care if they did.
All that was needed was a witch on a broomstick.
Your mother's a sensible woman.
Deuce take it, if you feel so badly.
He sprang toward her, filled with Berserker rage.
One grabbed me, but I got away.
But, all the same, you and the girl need checking.
I'll be a bull moose, if you say so.
Never mind, mumsy, Kitty soothed.
Notify the police
I want to get out of this blasted country.
Kittibudget, I'm not so strong for dukes as I was.
Kind-hearted, impulsive old dad!
suffer himself to be laughed at behind his back?
Hang it, they weren't so bally bad.
The hulking, shifty-eyed one fared worse.
Jameson looked into a pair of chilling blue eyes.
Lock this fool up till morning, said Haggerty.
Yelled at him, but he could run some.
Picked his pockets, if you want it blunt.
I can arrest you, Mr. Webb, British subject r not.
Don't be afraid of me
All y got t do is t treat me on th level.
Play your game above board
You've more mischief in you than a dozen kittens.
If he returns to America he'll be caught.
You'll never forgive me that black eye.
As if the first had not been colossal enough!
Now, then, come down out o that!
Never'll get that out o your head, will you?
Do you intend to remain long in America--incog?
Why was she always looking at him like that?
I eat Englishmen for breakfast
I'm beginning to like him, too, mother.
All right
You'll have to get a clairyvoint.
Probably this Lord Monckton was a la-de-dah chap.
A crowd in America is unlike any other.
It is full of meanness, rowdyism, petty malice.
If you're not Irish, it's no fault of yours.
I am afraid you are what they call blase.
Kittibudget, what the deuce is all this about?
Kitty, girl, you're as pretty as a primrose.
You are acting very strangely, dad.
He'll have to pay for that kiss.
Every one around here shall do as they please.
To condone an affront like this!
He could not understand these Americans.
You wanted an excuse to run away.
I am enjoying myself immensely.
For my part, I prefer em clinging.
She had notified the town police.
He's too bally soft on his feet to my liking.
Not at all sensitive about them, really.
I have fingers now as sensitive as a blind man's.
Kissed her and hadn't wanted to.
It is in the mother's milk they feed on.
Sapphires r here in New York, somewheres.
He'd taken em out o their settings.
As unblinkin a liar s I ever met.
All right I'll hike up t Bronx an get some duds.
Haggerty, the very devil is the matter.
Of all th gall I ever heard of!
Of all the fool situations, this was the cap!
Imbecility was written all over the face of it.
She picks em out the way I do, right off the bat.
I knew the game was up the moment I saw you.
It's up to Haggerty to find you.
He's going t interest me a hull lot.
Th stuff they put th maharajah t sleep with!
All y got t do is t act as I say.
VERDI: RIGOLETTO, IL TROVATORE, AIDA 238 XIII.
The Austrian soldiers are after me.
The Emperor was the enemy of Poland.
He does not respond to your wishes.
My friend, I challenge you to drink this health.
You are a pretty girl, he said boldly, ogling her.
some more of your trouble-making.
But, uncle, it is true that I am a victim.
There is no escape for you, Thaddeus.
Think not my warning wild, tis thy refound child.
Pizarro (governor of the prison).
what a day is this, My vengeance shall be sated.
This is too hard for thee, gentle boy.
Don Pizarro is frantic with rage.
Am I governing this prison or are you?
Now have done with your whimpering.
Reach me that pickaxe, he directed Fidelio.
As a man, he was entirely detestable.
He was malicious, born so, lived so, and died so.
Nay, she was a woman, said the Devil.
Then the Devil said in an undertone: She is coming!
I am trembling like a little child.
Now thy Marguerite is going to be hanged for it.
Get on, get on, the Devil cried.
Look out for her--she has a knife!
Get in there, Jose, and bring out the girl.
one would think a lunatic asylum loose.
She knifed one of the girls, did she?
Good-night, gentlemen, I'm off!
To your past success and to your future glory!
In a fight, in a fight we both take delight!
Let your uniform go hang, she answers.
Her screams bring the gipsies and smugglers.
This puts Jose in a truly bad way.
I stay where I belong--with my friends.
Well, you are not very good company.
Have at it, and the men fall to fighting.
Here I am, and here I stay, she declares.
So laugh, lads, and quaff, lads!
Woman, get thee gone, I'd rather live alone!
So do we mean _real_ donkeys, they sighed.
O lord, I don't want it---- I fl--oh!
Servant girls and stable boys--bah!
after all, they sound very gay indeed.
Tis our royal will and pleasure-- Hats off!
Oh, I am just like a lamb led to the slaughter.
Now, pray be lenient with them, brother.
Probably overworked by their last master.
Come, we've had enough of this!
Only sing for me--come, let us be gay.
We deserve anything he may say.
Bring them back, or ye shall suffer for it.
Lionel was pinioned and was being dragged off.
No, he declared, I will have none of it!
Aren't you ashamed of yourself!
I want to hear nothing from you.
You are the most ill-behaved children in the world.
What's that you say, you ungrateful child?
Do you know anything more about that awful ogress?
But there, what's grinning so there at me?
And gladly watch above them--sh!
And do you smell that delicious odour?
What are you here for, Santuzza?
Oh, stay with Santuzza--and her conscience!
God himself must have sent you here!
Good-bye, God bless you, mother.
you are all torn and---- Save me, save and hide me!
The soldiers are after us--look!
John replied, looking at Zacharia contemptuously.
He had already wrought untold pain and suffering.
Heaven has delivered thee into my hands!
while answering cries of Down with him!
reply to her, and she shall die, instantly!
This poor creature is demented.
Be thyself, John of Leyden, the innkeeper, my son!
Monostatos, a Moor in the service of Sarastro.
Sarastro, High Priest of the Temple.
Is this the face of your great Queen?
I cannot help thee, poor wretch, Tamino declared.
This must be the fiend himself.
Tamino cried, standing outside the temple.
Very well, it is your time to die!
Oh don't chastise my mother, Pamina cried.
I'll never speak another word, Papageno cried.
They had come to steal the temple.
She can do that almost any time!
Black-sheep dwell in every fold.
The women of the harem could not be seen.
Oh, I don't know--let him be arrested.
Yes, come here, you jesting fool!
We've had enough of your jests.
Then no place shall hide thee from my curse.
Don't curse me, the dwarf exclaimed, turning pale.
Aren't you afraid of being discovered?
She gets them to come
You'll regret not accepting my services.
I hear that old man's curse yet.
I am hired to bear the burden of their crimes.
You have never told me of my mother.
No matter, child, do not question.
I am feared and hated by my enemies.
The darkness blinds me, and I cannot see you.
See him fishing about in every corner for her?
I am an unfaithful fellow--but you don't mind that!
You mind your own affairs and get away from here.
I'll attend to my business, he snarled.
My own child had gone into the flames.
I come from Biscay, if you must know.
and she was instantly surrounded by the men.
He lifted her up, but she was already dying.
The knife falls--look upon the sight, old fiend.
His peace was destroyed forever.
Can you wish me greater ill than this, Princess?
Amonasro looked at her menacingly.
I will do whatever you desire, he cried recklessly.
I have betrayed my people to thee!
No, thy people are the people of Aida.
At the mention of Aida, Amneris was enraged.
Ye priests of Isis, ye are tigers!
Belongs first to the underworld and then the Gods.
Loge } Fricka } Freia } Goddesses.
Only listen to the languishing imp, they laughed.
Why not swim down and torment him?
We shall take the Goddess Freia.
Swing thyself down and I will follow thee.
My gold shall buy me even the Gods, themselves.
When this is done, she is thine.
Keep the ring, Fafner, Loge called.
Many have tried, but all have failed.
The conduct of these mortals is shameful.
So must the Eternals face extermination.
Obey me!--or thy punishment shall be terrible.
To disobey would be treason to the Gods.
Naught can save thee from thy punishment.
Walhall shall know thee no more.
Now by my head, I will stand no more of thee!
Such a nice, rosy little mouth.
He glared viciously at the little imp of Nibelheim.
The most absurd thing I ever heard, another called.
Master Beckmesser, you have gone too far.
I fear you have forgotten your own rules.
Did ever one hear of such a ridiculous rascal.
Beckmesser cried in a foaming rage.
Now listen to what I have to say, children.
I want you all to know that this maid is innocent.
There went a woman of darkness!
O great King and deluded Princess!
I confront him here and demand his name and land!
You might as well be in the moon.
Maybe they escaped from the Bronx?
I'm going to Egypt, and I'm going NOW!
I just couldn't stand it any longer.
little monk, in God's name forward!
I will rub out his name and put yours in its place.
for acting in concert and on the offensive.
But O, their lives they dearly sell!
The fault, said he, lies on thy head.
Strike, Frenchmen, strike; that's all my mind!
Please God the king may be able to apply a remedy!
His only aim is to crush the emperor.
Woe to thee, O country, that hast a child for king!
D'Argence understands him, and, Hide your face!
himself was inclined to consent.
I return thither no more unless I am dragged.
Very well, sir; then let him be tried and executed.
Rub your cheeks
sir, you are now our king and our master.
I wouldn't admit being on this planet in 76.
Fancy coming to the Academy to be clever!
Every reformation must have its victims.
Oh, you're simply exasperating.
The restraint must be dreadfully irksome to you.
You wouldn't have it hang around and look foolish.
Still you've got the heedless hartebeest.
You are really indecently vain of your appearance.
I always say beauty is only sin deep.
That's what I call being vindictive.
Women and elephants never forget an injury.
Then they will put up new wall-papers and forget.
I look rather nice when I lose my temper.
The Internet has the same effect.
It is a way to confound censorship.
But, you see, I'm so beastly thick-headed.
You're too square for that game.
They know the kind of things I like.
Johnson turned to Applerod with a snarl.
she asked him after he was all through.
blurted Applerod, now the aggrieved one.
You sold us out, lock, stock and barrel!
The governor just handed me one under the belt.
And this isn't the end, retorted Bobby.
Keep your hat on, Applerod, he ordered.
I'd be crazy, declared Applerod.
I'll run you into the penitentiary!
Indeed, I can wait, she whispered.
It remains to be seen if you are too useless.
You couldn't believe all you heard, you know.
That's your steady, ain't it, Bobby?
She's the real girl, he admitted.
This time the bet goes as she lays.
You take a real money drag-down from now on.
Give me a cigarette till I fumigate.
This is the way I figure the dope.
For that I'll have to manhandle you a little.
I've got all I can stand for from this rat.
He's a crook and an all-round sneak.
Moreover, I have bad news for you.
I am what Biff Bates told me I would be--the goat.
It is perfectly shameful, Bobby!
Don't bother with your friends.
After the first night they'll have this town crazy.
I'd be very foolish if I didn't.
If he ever does I'll slap his forehead, said Biff.
He's supposed to stab me with it in this next act.
Le Ricardo make fool over la MeeGeenees.
You can not fool wiz me, Monsieur Burnit.
I make what you call subpoena on zem all.
Agnes, I'm what Biff Bates calls a Hick!
He's a physical wreck and has been for two years.
Stone won't do a thing to _him_!
You will be beset as you never were before.
Say, Jolter, he added, it's bully fun being angry.
You know what this means, don't you?
You're getting to be a regular plebe.
Watch me become worse involved.
And here's the little message I got to give you.
Next time you're to have your head beat off.
You talk like him and act like him.
Why, Bobby, that's fighting fire with gasolene.
This crowd Bobby handled differently.
I declare I have no patience with you!
You're a fine and consistent enemy, he said.
If you don't stay I'll have you subpoenaed.
I'll teach you any time you like.
I'm going to leave this town for good, Burnit!
It's in the hands of a lot of pikers.
Let this be a lesson to you, young man.
Why, I own that undrainable swamp.
If you don't I'll throw you downstairs!
I'd be a fool to say I wouldn't, sir.
I beg pardon for calling you Biff, said he.
No more slang for your Uncle Biff.
Did you ever see her hand, Bobby?
Get her loosened up someway, can't you?
THE D BAR LAZY R BOYS MEET AN ANGEL IX.
DAVE MEETS TWO FRIENDS AND A FOE XVII.
JUAN OTERO IS CONSCRIPTED XLIV.
And on top of all that edjucation he can run too.
You got the sand to cover that?
Or are you plumb scared of my broomtail?
Dave, you're a chuckle-haided rabbit.
Didn't you sabe that come-on stuff?
Both of em are crooked as a dog's hind laig.
But Chiquito never went back on me yet.
It ce'tainly paralyzed him proper.
He got salivated as a mule whacker on a spree.
I know you won't throw off on yore old pal.
I'll kiss my twenty bucks good-bye cheerful.
You're more liable to collect the mazuma.
You make me good and tired, Doble.
They say one's born every minute, Ad.
Dawged if I don't believe it, he sneered.
We might hear you, advised Doble insolently.
His judgment was that his best bet was his fists.
They went down locked together, Dave underneath.
Dave looked down at the man's legs.
Dave he give me my money's worth that last round.
He's been livin soft too long, don't you reckon?
I been ridin on the point all day.
Two of the five are bein ridden.
Dug Doble received their decision sourly.
Em always acted like he was God Almighty.
Duck back into the restaurant, Bob.
You heard what I said to that man?
A b'ilin of men pour outa the place.
Don't pull yore picket-pin, Bob.
Ain't you goin to leave me trail along?
Think she picked you special for this job, do you?
I could a told you he had sand in his craw.
Em Crawford won't sign unless he's a mind to.
Y'betcha he'll talk turkey then, predicted Miller.
the squat puncher wanted to know.
Stick up yore hands--stick em up!
Heavy boots kicked at him where he lay.
Never liked you a lick in the road.
Bob, tie up yore friend's haid with a handkerchief.
They're going to be plumb sorry they got gay.
You got the most nerve I ever did see.
He cackled with splenetic laughter.
His heart was filled with surging hatred.
Yore old dad's not even powder-burnt.
But I got a boy out here that's beat up some.
You turn back and make me a bwidle, Dave, he cried.
If you do, play yore cards close.
We're only wastin our time here.
I'll dock you seven and a half for that.
I hear you've got to be quite a pet of his.
Well, o'course you're only boys.
Don't run on the rope with me, young fellow.
Come down and I'll wallop the tar outa you.
You'll never see that eighteen plunks, Em.
I reckon he was havin some fun joshin you.
He sputtered with the rage that boiled inside him.
If you told him to get em, nough said.
I'm the man you're lookin for, Mr. West.
Worked for the D Bar Lazy R last.
As the night grew older both men were busier.
Dave walked back along the roof to the caboose.
Say, are you comin or ain't you?
The conductor had a reputation as a bully.
That he had failed filled him with rage.
I don't have to put up with you, and I won't!
I says, You're some little kidder, and-- When?
Not none, announced the man from Arizona.
Watch me worry about your old cows.
Yore stubbornness is money in my pocket.
Most of my boys have when they hit town, I notice.
They act like they're sore as a boil at each other.
I breezed up wit a bottle an they kinda cooled off.
Some one steal a hawss from you?
Why can't I just take the hawss?
The law doesn't know it's yours.
After all, a bronc's only a bronc.
Well, I'll be doggoned, that youth commented.
The boys are for you strong, Dave.
Because I'm not going to stay and make you trouble.
Where in Mexico you been, old alkali?
Dawggone, but I'm glad to see you.
He had gone in a boy, wild, turbulent, untamed.
He's grown older, a heap older.
He's hard as nails--and bitter.
He's strong, and he looks at you straight and hard.
His flat, muscular back was rigid.
What was going to take place between these men?
Or he'll go to your room if you'd rather.
I always knew he had sand in his craw.
In a way it's a good thing this happened now.
I'm always glad to have my enemy declare himself.
He's headed for the hills or the border right now.
Or I can use you in the oil business.
Slick promoters are gettin rich.
We're all crazy, but we'd hate to be cured.
We haven't been lucky, like he has.
I don't aim to rile yore feelin's.
I reckon he didn't try awful hard to hit you.
He stayed right with it--tried to ride over her.
And I don't reckon any one would try to do that.
Mither o Moses, phwat was it hit us?
The squat puncher glared at his tormentor.
I'd say you got it comin to you.
He had been struck in the head by a heavy revolver.
You blew up the dam, charged Doble.
If you say we did, you're a liar.
No livin man can laugh at me and get away with it.
Wish you could see yoreself as we see you.
Must be bath night over at you-all's camp, Dug.
Dismal groans punctuated his profanity.
Dawggone my skin, if that don't beat my time!
That boy's sure some stemwinder.
He's crazy mad at all of us, but most at Dave.
It's time Malapi was civilized.
So he must go away, that's all there is to it.
Sand tastes, feels, looks, and smells like oil.
She will or she won't, you never can tell which.
You've earned what we voted you.
Say, you've ce'tainly been goin some.
What you did to both of em was a-plenty.
Don't let him get the drop on you.
Why, no, _I_ ain't, if that's what you mean.
He's crazy if he thinks he can get away with that.
I ain't heard what his story was.
We ain't gonna let anything happen to yore paw.
If it is, you betcha we'll get at the truth.
No, but I cayn't prove I didn't.
No, son, I cayn't tell that either.
Keep three shifts goin till she's under control.
We've got to get all Malapi busy.
When a guy puts up his dukes I'm there.
It's the quiet boys you want to look out for.
You got to know men, in my line of business.
No. You'll be luckier if you tell the truth.
He was a mountain of sagging flesh.
I'll back yore play, his friend said.
We're going to hang you, he said quietly.
I--I done Mr. Sanders a meanness.
None of my funeral, he said, his lips white.
I've a notion he's more scared of you.
Son, you've had a rotten deal handed you.
Don't hate my boy Keith, do you?
You're not parlor-shy, are you?
If you don't come, I'm goin to be good and sore.
I noticed he was near blubberin.
I expect it's Adios, Senor Miller.
That's private property, I reckon.
You'll have to raise scads of mazuma, son.
He tries to walk and talk like you.
Number Three's sure a-hittin her up.
She's no cougher--stays right steady on the job.
Bob did an Indian war dance in hip boots.
Tell it to me, you ornery ol scalawag.
Must have been scared bad, I reckon.
D you ever hear of a man land poor, Bob?
You don't remember me, Mr. West?
You can't change the facts, Mr. West.
Call him that if you've a mind to.
The boy was railroaded through on false evidence.
There's a bad gang down in that country.
Knows what he wants and goes right after it.
I believe you're in love with Dave Sanders, Dad.
I'd just like to shake the foolishness out of him.
He cayn't be gay as Bob Hart all at onct.
You wanta remember you're a li'l lady, he reproved.
Don't you see, I'm a marked man--marked for life.
If I come too near you, don't you see I taint you?
The stain of it's on me and can't be washed away.
You're eaten up with vain pride.
I was hard and bitter and defiant.
Now that's absurd, Dave Sanders.
He binds them hard and fast just the same.
But I wasn't lookin for no trouble.
Wanta see yore picture, I reckon.
Like to see my own picture on the poles.
Did you come here to make trouble, Dug?
I did it while he wasn't lookin.
What's wrong with him now, Dug?
Why, you got to protect yoreself, Dug, ain't you?
You're on the inside of a heap of rotten deals.
So am I. But I admit it and you won't.
With my friend Steelman, jeered Doble.
I'd like to hear some o that laughin.
Spit it out, or I'll tear yore arm off.
bellowed Doble, eyes like live coals.
Better get a gang together to fight it, Bob.
She's jumpin outa the gulch above.
You ride to town and rustle men.
A fellow likes to get things done.
He's got a man's job down there.
I got to rustle dynamite and men.
Says he's no quitter, whatever else he is.
They say Hart's in a heluva bad way.
It runs, senor, like a frightened jackrabbit.
It iss sent by heaven for a punishment.
You fired Bear Canon, charged the cowpuncher.
I've stood for a heap from you.
You'll stay right here, Dillon.
Dave's hard, chill gaze swept over his crew.
They had perished in the tunnel.
No, Keithie, you're too little.
Grow real fast and you'll be a big boy soon.
I gotta go to bed an sleep an sleep an sleep.
Joy, Joy, a man wants to see you!
Over there, Senorita, he waits.
I don't like a hair of yore head.
You're too good a man to go bad.
You've been running with a mighty bad pardner.
Both face and torso were raw with angry burns.
I've got a coupla casualties in my gang.
Lungs all inflamed from swallowin smoke....
You saved all their lives, I judge.
He punched cows for me twenty years ago.
Here's another load o grub, boss.
Juan Otero was one of Dug Doble's men.
Doble was capable of terrible evil.
No. Take as many men as you can get.
Dug ain't crazy even if his actions look like it.
she cried, terror rampant in her white face.
First, he must get rid of the child.
Don't be a fool, he told her irritably.
You're not gonna go, he told her flatly.
Please yorese'f, sweetheart, he jeered.
Doble added to his retort the insult unmentionable.
Yes, Dug sure had it comin to him.
I took notice it was a right busy li'l plaything.
But you got yore nerve all right.
Dave lifted her from the ground.
I was trying to get him closer.
What have you done to yourself?
He's not a bad man at all, really.
I didn't need that to know you.
Be good to her, or I'll skin you alive.
I will soon dispose of this unarmed man.
Are you satiated with the buffoonery?
Does not that action bespeak him criminal?
Help him a little, reverend priest.
or does he squander your substance?
Perhaps, you have a sick child there?
roar the others, and slay the adversaries.
We dust of dust, we curse of curse!
And I, when I say to him, Martin!
what does this nasty strange dog want here?
Now, mother, aren't you really glad you went?
You--you're going to be satisfied, Burt?
Keep stored in a cool place, and cook like sausage.

Now I must go back to war scenes.
My, what a nice, soft, sweaty time we had!
At that time I was almost blind with inflamed eyes.

These were his only and last words.
Probably 200 of us were captured.

SIMON BOLIVAR BUCKNER, Southern General.
DON CARLOS BUELL, Northern General.
I see you coming with these two eyes of mine.
An you see him an hear him talk every day?
For the most excellent reason in the world, Arthur.
I'm in the saddle all night with my troop.
He might have the approval of worse men.
I'll warm you and I'll dry you.
Wonder what they take us for anyway!
You have matched my victory with one of yours.
I'm the larger and the more powerful.
You'd better surrender, Mr. Kenton.
I'm a good swimmer, and you can't escape me.
You're splashing water, a useless waste of energy.
I really have no use for you here.
I wish you'd go away, Mr. Shepard, he said.
Which means that you don't belong in these parts.
Now don't you make one mistake.
Anyway I'm not the man you're looking for.
But I'm going to rob you just the same.
Don't want to be any kind of a corpse.
It's a good thing for you that it's so.
I dare say you've seen me often enough.
I believe you're an infernal rebel.
But then he was an obstinate Yankee.
Then I warn you that I may have to hurt you.
I'm just waiting here to see what you'll do.
Why don't you come on and attack?
And there is no Yankee cavalry in between?
They say you've been coverin yourself with glory.
So we could do no more than lose the plantation.
And will be in great enough force to defeat us.
Drink this, General, won't you?
Richmond was never gayer and brighter.
Sic semper tyrannis!_ So it was all over.
Now I'm going to bed, and maybe I'll sleep.
Because you're so full of life.
Try it, George, and see what happens to you.
We must all be searched, he said.
And I insist, too, that I be searched first.
You wouldn't treat me like that!
Throw over your cousin in such a manner!
With him it was just one pretty girl after another.
What's got into your head, Harry!
Go ahead and do what you want to do.
Now, why don't you find this mysterious terror?
She's been doing work for me for some time.
And she saved your life, too, you young wanderer.
I was not speaking of little girls.
We raided a little Yankee outpost.
They say this man Grant is a pounder.
He may be, but Lee is greater, greatest.
We ask you not to go on, General.
The battle in the center and on the left died.
Fiercer and fiercer grew the conflict.
His lips and his tongue were scorched.
And do you curve further to the rear, Harry.
Go ahead then and say it to me.
If he doesn't he'll be crushed.
You're growing poetical and poetry is no argument.
Take care of yourself, old man!
The sooner he withdraws the more men he will save.
No Yankee general can ever get by General Lee.
I never breathed such smoke before.
And Grant has not yet had enough.
Bet you even that I beat you into the water.
This is no place for you, General Lee!
Because you've left the way to your king easier.
Does he come around--er--often?
I did nothing of the sort, I snapped.
I don't think you're fair to yourself.
You'd better be warned in time.
You can sit down by the road somewhere.
I expected better of you, Lizzie.
That boy asked me and I refused.
Is she--is she always like this?
He has her hypnotized, Charlie.
I've selected you
But I think you're a bit of a coward, Jasper!
Ignorance is no defense and I know it.
He loves the God of America, said Tish.
And he is so pathetic, so grateful!
I stand in the presence of my three mothers.
You're a hard-hearted woman, Hannah Mackintyre!
This was absurd, as Tufik did not smoke.
This is your burden as well as mine, she snapped.
Evening, Miss Tish, he said, grinning.
People drown themselves in bathtubs.
Aggie sneezed all day and Tish had neuralgia.
This is your doing, Tish Carberry.
My stomach--I cannot eat in this America.
You must not become a Mohammedan.
Tufik takes but one wife, he said.
So that Tufik never forget America.
She must not die--she so young, so little girl!
We don't want to do it and you know it!
I hav but you and God--and God has forget!
They think Tufik only talks--now they see!
It smells like paregoric, Tish, she said.
That paregoric stuff has poisoned me.
He's as gentle as a woman to the people he likes.
I wisht I had Mr. Charlie by the neck.
They're a handsome lot generally, brown as nuts.
Yours for the Simple Life, CHARLIE SANDS.
II I am not trying to defend myself.
We shall bring back Mens sana in corpore sano.
Never mind, Aggie, Tish observed, very loud.
Don't skulk back there, she called.
Come out, where we can see you.
Tish turned on her stone and looked at me.
(Signed) ONE OF THE SIMPLE LIFERS.
He grabbed her and carried her off.
But that's not giving them to him.
Where do you think she gets them?
There's one here as big as a chicken!
Grab him as I throw him at you.
Sit down, man, and don't be a fool.
I'm a good bit worse than crazy about her.
If I don't get her, I don't want to live.
You've got enough flesh on you for a month.
The worse he thinks of us the better.
You old gypsies beat the devil!
You could shave as the Indians do, Tish said.
he demanded when Tish frowned him down.
I don't think he'll do it, boys!
And have a raft of men about all the time!
I can't swim, and you know it, Tish.
Also she said to wear mackintoshes and rubbers.
The young man has done nothing to justify rudeness.
Her subconsciousness is unusually active.
That boy's on the train, Lizzie!
You don't belong to the family.
That note was a warning to him.
He's a spy and the red-haired man is after him.
A word to the wise, Mister Happier Days!
Tish suggested that he was a woman-hater.
Primitive man, every inch of him!
My friend here will sit on the leak.
You and Aggie go, Lizzie, she said.
Then I went through his pockets.
The _y_ is especially vicious, she said.
Know the Indian mind and my own!
If I'm too obnoxious I'll clear out.
The girl came
When a red-haired person is pale, he is very pale.
You take my advice and go, Miss Tish, she said.
Smoking is the good man's only weakness.
I've been fleshy all my life, I said.
Not a muscle to divide between you!
What in the world are you doing, Aggie?
T-t-trying to breathe, poor Aggie replied.
You jarred me, and I am in no state to be jarred.
But you might keep an eye on her.
I asked, hearing Aggie's low groans.
Do you know what she's doing now?
No, Hannah, I said with bitter sarcasm.
You've been spying on Miss Tish, Aggie said.
She's a wonder, and no mistake.
You're not tongue-tied all of a sudden, are you?
I wish I had your breath, Lizzie, Tish said.
I'm not built that way, and you know it.
Safe and perfectly gentle, and as mild as milk.
Dear, dear now, would you look at that cinch!
Twenty centuries are looking down upon us!
I'll starve, Lizzie, that's all.
Aggie, fill yourself with ozone.
Here I am, and here I stay till I die.
I'll tell your niece when I see her.
That's between you and your Creator, Tish retorted.
I admit that the provocation was great.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, that's what they are.
They've got some Indians in it too.
You'll know as soon as is good for you.
She is to be captured by the attacking party.
It's a bully place for a picture.
I'd particularly like to get your Arab, he said.
They deserve everything they get.
And it's getting wilder every minute.
Not if it gets a good look at Aggie!
Now we'll gag him, Lizzie, she said.
We are going to leave you here, she said.
And don't move, she ordered them sternly.
Search her, Lizzie, she commanded.
she said, and pointed the revolver at each in turn.
Look, he's trying to pull her off and she won't go.
You have no one to blame but yourself, she said.
You are both only reaping what you have sowed.
You are not acting much like it.
She needs a strong hand, and, by George!
What is wrong with thee, John Blake?
I will put you under guard until you are wanted.
Lord Percy is the coolest of all.
Perhaps you would like to beg your life of them.
The farmer's eye blazes with rage and hate.
Dat's de wuss news I's heard in a long time.
Yah, und it beats der Irish too alretty!
She is so large they can't hide her very well.
What, did you leave your boat with that man?

They certainly ought to be punished.
Really they won't let me do a thing for myself!
And so do I, came from the other boys.

Then Hans got a nightmare and yelled Bop cats!
Some day I may place a monument over his grave.
Mine cracious, vos der a lion aroundt here?
Say, I ton't vonts me no snakes in mine!
asked the young Southerner, impatiently.
It's enough to give a fellow the creeps!
Well, you are the limit, Fred Garrison.
Keep quiet now, it will be best for you.
he yelled, at the top of his lungs.
But wait, pole her over to the barge.
If you do any firing, so will we!
stop that, or we'll fire at you!
Get behind the woodwork, he said.
I ain't vos tone noddings alretty!
Sheer off, or we'll all be wrecked!
Vos dose rascallions gone alretty?
But if I were you I'd fight shy of that Sack Todd.
Oh, gentlemen, it's all a mistake, he whined.
Did they bring you here and leave you?
It's mighty hard on a fellow as ain't done nothin!
I vos make a kick py der cabtain, ain't it!
do you threaten me on my own ship?
I can put you in irons for it, young man!
We are not going to touch you or any of your crew.
Say, I ton't vont no earthkvakes, not much I ton't!
Der oceans vos all busted up alretty!
Der vos no Dutchmans vot fly, vos dare?
Don't you fellows want to come up?
This is enough to give a fellow the creeps!
Maype you vos run us on der rocks, put in Hans.
I can't stand this much longer!
I was afraid I was going to be boiled alive!
If I don't, I feel black from head to foot.
I ton't run me no more, py golly!
It makes a fellow sick, doesn't it?
And just when we were doing so nicely too.
He just told me to slow down more yet.
Th--the mast came down on m--me!
I vos eat vot I blease, Sam Rofer!
Dot vos vot I vos going to see.
Wait a minute, and I'll throw you a rope ladder.
I am not going to prison just yet.
Oh, he'll have to do as we say.
Hans isn't here, he went on, down the tube.
I don't want any of you to come closer.
We have as much right to her as you have.
Because if you do, we'll treat you well.
Then you'll have to take the consequences.
But they handled me pretty roughly.
I vish I could drow dem all oferpoard, ain't it!
What, you wouldn't poison them!
Stiff as corpses, was the brutal answer.
I tell you, that dope did the business.
Otherwise they'll surely die on our hands.
I'd like to make all of the gang prisoners.
Don't you dare to make another sound.
You didn't want to see us doped, as they call it?
Ton't dare to mofe, Hans was saying.
Paxter, he ton't got avay from me, not much!
We've given them the same dose they gave us.
And there is another thing, went on Dan Baxter.
Yah, I ton't stand in nopody's vay, added Hans.
Stop, or we'll open fire on you!
They value their worthless hides too much.
Put them where they can't do any harm.
I am here, said the former bully of Putnam Hall.
I told you I didn't like his looks.
Then you'll have to wait until later for more.
If you don't keep quiet you'll get the worst of it.
Wait till I get my hands on you!
You're a villain if ever there was one, Sack Todd.
You might as well give up, he said to Gasper Pold.
Thank you, answered the former bully, humbly.
He expects to be placed on trial.
Because fighting is not always right, my boy.
he exclaimed, are you mad, boy?
I'm sponsible to your mother for you.
Stay, I'll do the thing myself.
You weren't looking at me, and I didn't move.
P'r'aps not, lad; but you winked.
That's wot I calls the feelosophy of obsarvation.
Don't stop tellin till I'm safe off.
Why don't ye build a log hut, and enjoy yerself?
Why, you're as hale and hearty as the best on us.
I ver moch sorray dat I be give you von fright.
I'm your man
Why, I tell ye I've seen the _bars_ smell em.
The fact is, they _can't_ bust.
They're too useless even for that.
do stand still, just as you are, men!
mon garcon, you is so drefful slow.
we have noting--dey have everyting.
Here's your blunderbusses, I guess, mister.
The Indians were appalled by the sight.
An what did he when the Indians ran away!
Neither does he eat human flesh.
Depend upon it scalps will be taken ere long.
Wall, if ye bean't old, ye ain't exactly a chicken.
I've ta'en a sort of fancy to your face.
Dis is de von as vill do it more slicker by far.
The missile went true to the mark and felled him.
One powerful Indian seized March by the throat.
Well done, the Wild Man of the West!
Not badly hurt, young man, I trust.
He ain't to be trusted, he ain't, that feller.
I guess we'll have nothin to say to em wotiver.
More than that, I'll never go to sleep any more.
Me sit here till you sleep, after that me go away.
Perhaps it will cure me, especially if you feed me.
Is it long since they left ye, mother?
he said, after she had swallowed a little.
But he had to leave me
No, I would not; I would do him good.
Yes, replied the girl with a gay smile.
Just see what them reptiles ha done to me.
Hims look to me--me's look to him.
Smokin and drinkin are both alike.
An pray, Mister Solomon, do _you_ smoke?
Adam's wife never got the better o that.
Use yer eyes now
I don't want them, an they don't want me.
I believe the head's stickin in my back.
Did ye iver hear such a roarer, comrades?
She must be a good mother that o yours.
Let me see the words, boy; are they there?
Didn't she think his taste was good?
he whispered, my wanchee you keep mouth shut.
Then he chuckled a cold, dry chuckle.
The Russian was not looking up.
Now, he mocked, now I have you, sir.
Before releasing him, he searched him carefully.
They think he's from the Russian Government.
Failing in this, she gave it a number of punches.
Communism isn't so bad for him after all.
Everything belongs to the tribe.
No go, said the native, his voice rising.
Johnny's good right arm had done that.
About his neck was a skin rope.
There were a dozen natives in the room.
What did they want to hang him for?
See here, he said sharply, this man, no die, See?
The cult had spies and avengers everywhere.
This she found crowded with natives, mostly men.
They say, that one; they say all; you die.
No, Johnny was not running from the Russian.
Then a gasp escaped his lips: The Russian!
Yes, and worse, many times worse.
Whatever else you are, I don't know.
She blushed through her brown skin.
We will get that man, you and I, and--Iyok-ok.

At that the Russian's rage knew no bounds.
Did you find it last night in the submarine?
Last night was a bad night for me.

RESTORATION OF LAW AND LIBERTY 18.
But he will be tried, as fire tries metal.
She was very young, little more than a girl.
Sera cried out: The Black Ones!
They have died, but the evil died with them.
Of that monstrous mating came the Black Ones.
May fortune favor you, outlander.
Kepta, son of vileness, Thrala is not for you.
A clean beast, Kepta, which you are not.
They have taken her back to the cells.
Meanwhile, I leave you to each other.
Garin was already busy with the rod.
And the morgels see in the dark....
They have set the morgels on our trail!
Now send you to dust this black throne....
Forty days have we and then the Black Ones come.
Do as you desire, Dweller in the Light.
I am a fool, said the American slowly.
Please feel free to smoke, David.
Carrying pestilence and disease and terror.
Well, I didn't intend to get off on this.
These natives, the general said.
I can't think of them as intelligent at all.
You're like lawyers, all you technicians.
I've known a lot of guys like that in my time.
Patches of toilet paper all over his face.
Half my men are down with the virus.
It is not true, he said, it is not true!
Gentlemen may cry order and interrupt me.
Perish such demagogy--such senseless stuff.
The law will triumph and the evil stop.
He had been a Whig, and now he abused the Whigs.
You see the traitor before you.
He was captured, tried, convicted, and hanged.
They have lost their shame with their virtue....
He is immortal, as the people are eternal.
Refuse that, and you present us war.
He thinks I pant for it, poor fool.
George W. Smith I see every day.
I am sir, Your obedient servant, ROBERT TOOMBS.
Your obedient servant, ROBERT TOOMBS.
Brown's and Chambers policy is all foolishness....
The militia are coming up finely.
Georgians are all coming up well except the cities.
The country was swarming with raiders.
Then get it out of me if you can.
Joe Deas, she said, are you a fool?
General, you say you won't be taken alive.
To me it is becoming intolerable....
Kiss the dear little children for me.
Yours truly and affectionately, as ever, TOOMBS.
I have not pardoned you all yet.
By the Living God, they shall pay them.
If she does not, I will pay them for her!
Bacon was not accused of selling injustice.
My opinion of the Yankees is apostolic.
The Lord reward him according to his works.
This is the end of the just in this world.
These people are trying to usurp your functions.
Zachary Taylor was the most ignorant.
Sister Liza, you'd better get a pillow!
_Arethusa!!_ If you don't sit down!...
Yours affectionately, ROSS WORTHINGTON.
Run along, Timothy, if _you're_ afraid.
I call it dirt mean to make her suffer so.
But I couldn't get any wetter if I stayed.
Ef Mis Liza wuz jes to see you all now!
And you behave just like a child!
It was far too small for him in every possible way.
She'd say it was rude, and you know it.
He makes me so mad I could just....
He says he likes to see me get mad, and I ...
with a most scornful emphasis, her voice rising.
That was a most foolish remark.
Such a thing could never be, and you know it.
What you call love is just pure silly!
I think it's the very ugliest name I ever heard.
The girl was getting more and more foolish!
She is pure beauty and pure everything else.
And Where ignorance is bliss, you know.
Don't look so stern, Woman, I do write her often.
Because I won't have you, that's why.
I didn't bring you up here for that....
Timothy was silent for a moment....
Suit yourself, she replied, indifferently.
replied Arethusa, very sarcastically.
Oh, I forgot, Timothy rolled over.
Grown girls don't kiss grown men.
It's just like poor white trash!
What's the matter with you, Timothy Jarvis?
You're plenty old enough to know better'n this.
And you ain't never seen your Pa?
And you're so much smarter than I am.
I don't look like my mother, and you....
Oh, please go on and stop fooling!
If you did, you wouldn't laugh!
We'll go right up to your room.
There's oceans of time for you to change.
Did she cut it up before hand, or what?
was his rather inappropriate exclamation.
She must be more careful of her tongue.
His glance searched her, up and down.
Say, he exclaimed, that hurt like fury!
He ought to be barred from em by law.
Then let me give you another lesson, now....
She is said to be somewhat proficient at it.
The curtain descended once more, and this time....
_Why_, I wouldn't laugh at _you_ for all the world!
Sposin she don't come back with it?
It's none of your business whether I had or not!
She wouldn't care the least bit.
That nasty old beast of a woman!
He's just got to come, that's all!
Oh, I just hate him for acting this way!
Let me come around where you are, can't I?
You're always so awfully rough.
Then as a supreme inducement and a last resort....
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
And _I_ most certainly didn't like _him_!
He's a four-flusher, for fair, if ever _I_ saw one!
You're not nearly so pretty with it, either.
There's nothing the matter with that nut!
You just take that back right now, Billy Watts!
And he's sick, he told me so himself!
Come on now, Arethusa, and be a better sport!
He kissed her square on her sweet mouth.
This last was also an interrogation.
And I really didn't mean a single thing!
I don't want to hear anything you have to say!
And Timothy was exactly right about you!
I can't let you do a thing like that....
His had been the Kiss of a Judas!
And this time, it was with what Dire Results!
And I'm just as sorry as the deuce!
And he just's running himself thin!
Don't be such an old prophet of evil!
I'll have you out now in a jiffy!
I want you, yourself, to get my hair out.
Paul, I can't always do your fightin for you.
It ain't only the Marquess kid you're fightin.
These people were whipped, starved out, beaten.
Not enough to feed a sick pigeon with.
Power is what I want an it's what I'm goin to have.
Julius Caesar couldn't do nothin here.
Ain't a little bit better than nothin whatsoever?
Heretofore you've done it willin'ly.
Did you hear what I said to you?
Ham may talk, but he won't desert.
That's not the question, mother.
He went, an now he's restin down there at Shiloh.
Please do not tax my patience longer.
You are fully dressed, are you not?
Let us be frank with each other.
When I give presents to a woman, it will be to you.
Scorn it and it serves you blindly.
I know you aren't afraid of any physical attack.
When he smashes us, we'll know all right.
There's nothing ambiguous about his wallops.
Most men come to me when I send for them.
Grant that all your self-adulation is warrantable.
Your ticker isn't silent out there.
It's not your custom to be uninformed.
You come urging peace with threats.
I don't even know that he was a real man.
You don't even know what I'm like.
I have a very definite idea what you are like.
That's worth refusing to die for.
That comes later, she reminded him.
Never until today did I face the truth.
You call yourself an artificial little flirt.
Besides, did any woman ever flirt with you?
Or kiss your lips--like this--would you?
You can go and dance, if you like.
Trust him to make himself a nuisance.
Then his voice snapped into animosity.
I hate the pampered brother--but Thayre is right.
There were plenty of other girls, weren't there?
Why do you avoid me as if I were a pestilence?
Gentlemen, this man is a charlatan.
As his power grows his menace increases.
We are rearing a Frankenstein, gentlemen.
she told the man, and he swiftly demanded: Hate me?
Therefore we must be crushed--if possible.
They hate me, because they fear me!
he demanded as he kissed her pale cheek.
These gentlemen think they won't turn loose.
I said get his Coal and Ore, or get him.
If you prefer, gag him and drag him here.
Doesn't want to be disturbed--he's got to be....
You understand me, don't you, Carter?
It is possible to suffocate on incense.
It is an attack of indigestion.
You don't know what this matter is!
My egotistical boy, she said in a low voice.
At all events I can overthrow you.
I was too busy crying to see you, he laughed back.
Do you know, I have the instincts of a sybarite?
I am asking you a question and I demand an answer.
I will go back into the Street.
I will bury you deep beyond salvation!
You are the pirate and no more.
I will not call your boast empty.
I would wreck all New York to smash you.
He is my man, and my place is with him.
It outweighs even a Monte Cristo's arrogance.
It is to be war now, and bitter war.
He is a traitor and I have marked him for ruin.
For God's sake, he cried, don't.
I have no intention of tame submission.
You must have a Burton to fight this Burton.
This is a den of bears you know.
yes, like a strangling man wants breath, he said.
I had my chance and have failed.
I don't need you either, I don't need anyone.
Of course, that would make you hate me.
It must make anyone hate me if it's true.
Whatever he did he must appear a weak fool.
to give you all a woman can give a man.
I haven't been happy for years.
If he means to fight he must fight now.
If he thinks he can stop us let him try.
We expect you to stand your pro rata.
E-D-W-A-R-D-E-S A-N-D E-D-W-A-R-D-E-S.
MARKET TAKES TURN BURTON BROKERS BIDDING UP.
Hamilton Burton took me and squeezed me dry.
My family will be in the streets.
She is in no condition to stand more of this.
but you men that want everything ...
She is only going on her nerve.
Now it's all going to be harder.
It won't take you so long to get down.
demanded the member, stiffening with indignation.
You great artist--you not un'stand making money.
No, Yamuro, you have done enough--God bless you!
Loraine Haswell and his own cowardice!
If I ever become a man, God knows I'll come to you.
I know and I saw your eyes as you refused.
Is it so bad as all that with you?
Now I'm coming to it and I'm going to put it plain.
He said the women would eat that up.
Remember that this is the capital of sharks.
Tomorrow's the limit of my patience.
She don't seem to take no interest in her act.
You ain't never suspected he was a crook before.
I ought to run you in for your own protection.
I ought to have locked him up the first time.
For God's sake, leave me alone.
These lives are ended, but yours is beginning.
Keep him covered till I tie her up.
commanded L'Olonnois, ignoring him; what else?
A boy I had never been; nay, nor even a youth.
You led Jimmy into that with you.
I tried now to be fair
Come here, Tige, you blame fool!
Someways, maybe dogs and boys understands quicker.
Because, you seem like a real pirate to us.
So, after now, we'll call you Black Bart.
He rushed, and my left fist caught him on the neck.
Drop your weapons--that isn't fair.
Press up until he begs our pardon.
You couldn't do it if you'd fight fair!
Me payin my money in and gettin no protection.
They were crooked and awkward, but they came hard.
Unconsciously, he put a finger to his swollen nose.
The more he got, the more he wanted.
He never was a boy like you and me.
Jimmy L'Olonnois, little do you know what you say!
Was I a ruler, or a private man, or a lame man?...
Throw up your hands, or by heavens you die!
No, that is not why you failed.
So think not, fellow, to escape us!
So, it's you for the fair captive, huh?
Why don't we run in and board her?
While I attend to him, you, L'Olonnois, run aft.
Are you with me, my bold mates?
Go over there, Peterson, and quiet him.
I stretched out my arms, craving, demanding.
Run me through, you varmint--what do you mean?
Enough of all this noise, I said.
Little do you know what lies before you.
Ain't you poor, then, Black Bart?
Little do you know what lies before you!
I wonder where he is, and what he will say.
She say, she say, Misal Hally, she say no come.
Yon varlet has wired on ahead to have us stopped!
An let any pursue us at their peril!
She knows you're poor, all right.
Marry the captive maid your own self?
An they founded families that---- Jimmy!
Take the chance, Peterson, and run into the bayou.
If you can not, all the same you must and shall!
Is there no law for such as you?
You may hate me, despise me, Helena.
There are plenty of girls in the world---- One.
I know what I covet, and by the Lord!
nothing shall stop me, least of all the law.
And you're filling his head with wild ideas.
You were just like all the rest.
When that was gone, you cared nothing for me.
You have a poor ear for music, John Doe.
Let me hear no more such talk, or by my halidom!
The train is too close, said I, smiling grimly.
I'll not try to take the train.
You have been presumptuous and overbearing.
We might be arrested and put to a lot of trouble.
Let's board her and take her, hissed Jean Lafitte.
And you do hate me very much, do you not?
It was wrong, foolish of me, Harry.
Take me back, she said, her voice low.
Till the end of the world I'll hate you.
Tis I, Black Bart, I answered, full and clear.
Maybe them folks has a'ready dug em up.
You grow flippant as well as rude, sir!
Your effrontery amazes me--I doubt your sanity!
It's getting black, and it's colder.
And it's getting black, and the fog is coming.
Ah, fine of you to persecute a girl!
If I were to drown, I'd not take aid from you.
It's about all a coward can do for you.
S'posin we don't hit her, in this fog!
It's this d----d fog that makes it bad.
I--am--going--to--die, going to _die_!
Stay right where you are--and you also, Miss Emory.
Course he would, only he's so awful sick.
I ain't sick--yet, but I feel funny, someway.
When we hit that white water---- Shut up!
Safe as a church, here or there, you lubbers.
Take Williams to run her motor for you.
What are you trying to do, Mr. Harry?
We can't leave the poor devil helpless, that way.
You'd only swamp her, if you tried.
John, said I, I catchee plenty wind this time.
I know you come back allee time bimeby, one time.
They have their own ways, these people of the East.
I expect she's sprung a leak, all right.
Regular greenheads, like we get up North.
Am I not a coward--did you not tell me so yourself?
I was the same man then that I was last night.
Go back and tell your aunt that you have won.
My name is L'Olonnois, the Scourge of The Sea.
An we was havin such a bully chance!
Me, I buy me some net for s'rimp.
An where you'll goin', Monsieur?
No man he'll mawnkey wit Monsieur Edouard, heem!
You're a fine pirate, ain't you, Black Bart!
--Or else she'd walk the plank.
I'll do nothing of the sort, Jimmy.
I wisht I was under them fellers right now.
It is Portia judges this world.
Why, me and Jean Lafitte and the heartless jade.
She said, I can't go, and I said, You _gotta_ go.
He called you a heartless jade---- The little imp!
When I said--when I called you--a coward.
I say it now to your face, Harry.
There were other men in the world for you.
No. I could barely hear her whisper.
He never has done that way for me.
He loves you more, and you don't deserve it.
I am in the power of a ruffian band!
And you have been a cruel and ruthless pirate.
Beshrew me, but it shall go hard with him!
I'm loading her up with marbles now!
Oh, I say, there, you Harry, confound you!
He'll wouldn't took four days now, Monsieur!
And I say, isn't Sally a humdinger?
Then I'd a-got the mine and the girl both, maybe!
And may God bless us, and all true lovers!

OH, LOOK, MUMMIE, I'VE FOUND A SNUGGLER'S CAVE!
Now, what's the cotton round your finger for?
UTHER'S SON, RIGHTWISE KING OF ALL ENGLAND III.
God preserve me from your subtile crafts.
And also I must follow this damsel.
I charge you slay this traitor.
Then they cried all at once, Slay him.
For all you I might have been slain.
So she died, and all was done as she desired.
And a clean maiden I died, I take God to witness.
I know well mine uncle will be avenged upon me.
About six of the leaders were executed.
Ar-pi-uck-i, or Sam Jones, his X mark.
Moki-his-she-lar-ni, his X mark.
Three of the four were executed.
The whites always suspect such ones.
Let the Americans have their land immediately.
The request being refused, the town was bombarded.
A dog has a better, that's sheltered and fed.
Whate'er's to be done, Poor black must run.
A single victim only was sacrificed there.
This was neither true nor just.
Frequently they were clubbed or whipped.

The fool parson, to let such a chance go!
They both perished on the battle-field.
It was not Munich, Fastidiosus.
Many men of note were in their seats that night.
Physically certainly he was superbly endowed.
But a counts them every night when's desart's done.
And he said, It's not my _'scusis_.
I'll tell you what that book's good for, Chris.
Not a toad, but a F. R. O. G. frog!
It suits you much better than being a Queen.
Boys be so destructive, John said.
The new earth that's just underneath.
I put em all on myself, everyone of them.
But do leave off staring at your legs.
Zo let young lady have un, her says.
Toast and water, said Chris, maliciously.
Just like their mother, as I told her.
Wait a minute--I know which you shall be.
I only begged him to avoid my labels.
I don't care a fig for Jemima, said her husband.

Jump into the fire if you want to, said she.
Go back to your room, she said to Hannah.

She has an awful lot of them lately.
Folks are silly enough for anything.

She ought to live with her folks.

IN THE WAKE OF THE PH[OE]NIX: POEMS.
This mortal nevermore can lie To immortality.-- Oh!
Full of power, of ecstasy, of a fury of joy.
His work is above all things virile...
Yes, I said my name was Gipsy--G--I--P--S--Y.
Nothing in the least barbarous about you.
Why, you must have been to a fresh one every year!
Especially in only one's nightdress!
Mind you don't get pitched out of your bunk.
They're turning her about and putting her back!
All my valuable papers are gone, child!
You don't realize yet what that means.
You're never going to leave me behind!
That's not the question at all, Gipsy.
Gipsy, you're an Oliver Cromwell!
Don't stand any nonsense with the Third.
All the other societies are equally bad.
In the name of Liberty, I ask you!
Just you quit, and be quick about it, too!
Do you want to be turned out by brute force?
We'll stand no nonsense this time.
We can't allow this kind of thing!
Don't stand any nonsense from them!
You can sit down, Gipsy Latimer.
We won't be sat upon by a clique!
For President, I beg to nominate Gipsy Latimer.
We'll soon pull you up if you do, never fear!
She's absolutely forming herself on Gipsy.
Yourself not excepted, I suppose!
She's ready for any amount of fun.
So'd you be if you'd once tasted it, I guess.
I call it neglect of your education.
I'm not going to break any rules, said Gipsy.
You kids mind your own business!
Poppie didn't see your privileges!
I feel as if I were shut up in a box!
Did your headmistress ride too?
You'd never sit that wild thing!
You'd better not try to catch that creature, Gipsy.
It'll pretty soon kick her off if she does!
It was very naughty of you, you know, Gipsy dear!
Why, child, you're all trembling!
And serve you right too, for forgetting!
Gipsy Latimer, go back down the stairs!
Come along, you wild gipsy thing!
you never--you couldn't-- Oh, surely----!
Only three this afternoon, missy!
You must wear your thick one now.
Hadn't your mother any relations?
Mother was an American, from Texas, I believe.
It's much better to nail people.
We don't want her to feel uncomfortable.
She won't find that in a hurry!
Where's your atlas, Gipsy Latimer?
No, I'm not going to accept any excuses.
Look here, kiddie, you get on and tell us!
Then they're most enormously rich people.
What a set of sillies you all are!
She's not one half as nice as Gipsy.
I've made you as comfortable as I can here, child.
Oh, yes, heaps, as much as she likes to ask for.
I think she's too contemptible for words.
You'd like us to put your name down, wouldn't you?
Serves you right, Leonora Parker!
It will be a surprise for her later on.
As long as she's fair, that's all I care about.
We look like a set of grinning imbeciles!
I don't like these foreign ways.
I rue the day she came into our dormitory.
You want to try yourself, I suppose!
Wouldn't you like to use the rope?
You'd do Gipsy no good, I'm afraid.
So it's you, Gipsy Latimer, is it?
I might have known it would be you.
Oh, Gipsy, we're all so sorry for you!
I'm off too, then, returned Gipsy.
But I tell you I won't be taken!
Surname Latimer, Christian name Gipsy.
Eyes brown, complexion dark, hair brown.

Your own folks are the best to look after you.
You're rather juvenile for the job, ain't you?
Shielding herself at your expense!
And disgustingly mean of you, too!
I'm sick of Briarcroft and its strict rules.
She didn't even tell you she was sorry, Gipsy!
Poppie's pet won't be expelled, no fear!
You've not begged Gipsy's pardon yet.
Will that suit you, little woman?

What a gammy old croaker you are.
I'm going to round up, right alongside.
Why don't you emigrate to the States?
It's worse than that, replied White.
Did you miss the train after all?
I don't know, replied White, bitterly.
They will say yours, or your mother's, of course.
I'm going to stay and face the music.
Ze material mus all ze same be remof.
What are you doing here, you French beggars?
And I will not allow it removed.
Whenever I feel abused I'll let you know.
Do you want to heave to and let them overhaul us?
They have given it up, old man, and we are safe.
I say, White, come up here quick!
And we did the same by you, laughed White.
Your skin must be thicker than sole leather.
FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE NATIVES.
Get tea, sugar, plenty, eat heap, you understand?
I am glad you only spoke, remarked White.
Oh, clear out, you grinning baboon, growled Cabot.
No. What are the Indians doing?
You are really human after all!
No; I am sound as a nut, replied White.
But of course you must have some, White.
AN ELECTRICIAN IN THE WILDERNESS.
Are you wounded, or just naturally ill?
Why are you masquerading as a man-wolf?
Good-night, good-bye, God bless you!
Cabot, are you crazy, or what do you mean?
You can't even smell the smoke in this chapter.
Scare the life out of me with clubs and forearms?
I said to myself; wake me early, mother dear.
all of a sudden I went kerflop off the barrel.
Wake up, your country needs you.
You're a raving Raven, Westy began, laughing.
Anyway, I'm not going to be a quitter.
We're here because we're here, you can't deny that!
But they can't come any of that business up here.
The man said, Taint youster; _'tis_.
Oh, but he's a reckless boy--not.
If they don't know they can't come, can they?
He even breaks the rules, I said.
_RIDGEBORO RIDGEBORO_ TEN CENTS.
You look too sweet for anything, Westy told him.
Oh, _isn't_ he just too _cute_ for _anything_!
Get up, you're blocking the traffic, I said.
Scouts can do everything like that.
Oh, aren't you _perfectly terrible_!
A scout has to be full of that, see?
Perish, he said; don't you know what perish means?
I did, anyway; I screamed till I had a headache.
You think you're smart, all of you, don't you!
You'll be the one to make _us_ sick, Westy put in.
He didn't care about anything, I guess.
I wonder what became of the ch--ch--ch--icken!
You've done mischief enough for one day.
It's good they don't have any traffic cops here.
Yez are blockin up the road, yez are.
Yez are a pretty fresh lot, ain't yez?
And you're a couple of crazy fools, too.
You'll only make it worse for yourselves.
_Steal a Pierce-Arrow!_ You make me laugh.
You couldn't even get away with a Ford.
Go ahead, run, he said; it won't do you any good.
Sink this car in the lake if you want to.
I bet it belongs to a rich millionaire.
It won't be hard, with their pictures.
I'll never forget Buffalo, 398 Mls.
She doesn't stop here, does she?
Reg'lar private car, you kids got, he said.
A mile isn't fast, you crazy Indian!
Look out you don't fall, Kid, I told him.
Telling your patrol leader to shut up, are you?
Are you game to climb up on the car?
Get the sheet and the rope, quick.
You never saw him back down, did you?
We've got her eating out of our hands.
P-f-f-f-f-f-f, the locomotive went.
I took one look and _g--o--o--d_ night!
I suppose that's the skiddo special.
Probably we'll be dumped off a cliff.
The pleasure is mine, I told him.
Oh, boys, where do we go from here?
The big fancy doll said, You're welcome.
There were all kinds of people in that crowd.
Shut up, you're the worst of the lot!
He's supposed to be tender, see?
If you've got any kick, go to the railroad.
It's you that happens to be here, not these boys.
Flopped by the only original Boy Scout flopper!

The rest of you might as well go to your bunks.

Think of having a price on our heads!
Good please Mr. Satan fish, take some one else.
We's all goin to be devoured alibe!
He looks like he could, said the colored man.
Look ahead, an you can't see nothin!
They're going to fight up here!
I'm not slowin down, replied the colored man.
The leak must have been a bad one.
You will find the air a little fresher down there.
Fust I know I'll be a perfessor myself!
Crossing the line makes no difference.
We must get him out quickly or he will die!
You know South America is a great place for them.
I'll bet she's been laying eggs!

Shut the door of the conning tower!

I turned away somewhat sickened.
My hare is still at large, he confessed.
I grew as laconic as the Huron.
The Huron is waiting for your answer.
They have bound the Englishman!
Will monsieur turn pupil to learn swaggering?
Do you think you are running from the Iroquois?
But we will shut you out of the country yet.
Are you willing to be judged by your own?
Yet, in truth, your face is longer.
There are Indian women in plenty.
But are there no white families in the settlement?
He tried to resist, but I am strong.
It will mean failure to you--to your people.
I have no liking for white meat broth myself.
I was forced to approve my man's taste.
I mean that
I caught the spear, and cursed myself for a fool.
You have not blinded these people.
Good God, man, you are worse than the Iroquois!
Then he pulled me back into the room.
To starve or be eaten by wolves!
Now it is your turn to play the child.
I am not doing this for France, I cried irritably.
He is bitter of tongue, and, I think, a spy.
I pressed him to a chair, and stood over him.
Wait, wait, monsieur, I have not said all!
You said--you said that I had to die.
Let us discuss this like sane men!
I was not at the bottom of him yet.
You said we were foes, and we are.
Monsieur Starling, wake up to this situation.
What does it matter what you are, or what I think?
I pushed him within, and closed the door.
My neck, where I am not sunburned, is very white.
And in case you still live, monsieur, he corrected.
And one does not hate an inferior.
And you sit here doing nothing!
she cried, quite as a white girl might have done.
Why try to teach decency to a barnyard brood!
His fingers were warm, and his touch tingled.
I dropped my hand from his mouth.
Gesture, and roll of the head, he was an Indian.
I dropped the priest, and gripped the Englishman.
You are a logician, I said bitterly.
Was there a coward streak in him, after all?
But no one sees you but the Indians.
Monsieur, do you like to wear a squaw's dress?
Monsieur, it could not have been a real Indian.
Why did a Huron dog us in this fashion?
You are less cynical than your wont, monsieur.
May I say that I like it better in you?
Therefore I must be harsh with you.
There must be no woman in the camp.
And I cannot forget you are a woman.
I must let the men know that you are a woman.
Spare your scorn, mademoiselle.
Oh, monsieur, I have not the courage!
Then--then--monsieur, I give you warning.
Yes, I threaten you, in that I shall do what I say.
Monsieur, the Iroquois are allies of the English.
Otherwise--I have warned you, monsieur.
That is a coward's threat, I said contemptuously.
Sit with me a little longer, monsieur, she begged.
Have you a woman's heart, I wonder?
A Huron is in the woods, he said indifferently.
When a Huron comes, you will soon see the French.
No, monsieur, you must not follow me.
I am not quite a brute, I said.
Look, look, mademoiselle, it is all over.
He could not track me, monsieur.
Do you want him to find you, mademoiselle?
She watched me straighten the kinks in the wire.
I grasped my knife and whirled.
I lit my pipe and let her work it out.
I could feel her quick breathing.
I laid a hand on her wet blankets.
I saw her look at me once, and look away.
That was not a scratch, monsieur.
I think that you know what I mean, She said.
I could feel her other hand stray toward me.
We shall both sleep now, madame.
My serenity has not been calculated.
To the Winnebagoes,--to another tribe of Indians!
You are giving her a hard life.
I asked, with my lips on her hand.
Upon the English if they venture near.
He hates you if you humbled him.
He would not dare harm a Frenchman, madame.
Men say that it does, monsieur.
I heard them melt, melt into nothing.
He did it with his glance hard on me.
A woman was between us, and I knew no mercy.
Then you would have been a double coward.
You think to reinstate yourself?
No, you shall not see my wife, monsieur.
I shall sit here till you move, monsieur.
There was sweat on your forehead.
I will let you go when you tell me the truth.
Where are your Indians that Cadillac sent with you?
The Indians wanted prisoners, not scalps.
Your men were cowards, he muttered.
So a coward could despise a coward!
Is there a slur in that remark, monsieur?
Monsieur, this is wanton insult.
Pemaou would not dare harm the woman.
Monsieur de Montlivet, you know Indians.
I fingered my pipe and bit hard at its stem.
He had the woman captured and brought to camp.
I see that I wronged you, monsieur.
Remember, she has kissed me, monsieur.
What do you know of her kisses?
You evidently married my cousin for convenience.
A leering Iroquois stood over me.
He spoke to me in French, but I was deaf.
He was unbound and mingling with the Indians.
Pemaou was capable of tricking a confederate.
They say the Frenchman, Montlivet, can do that.
The stupefying simplicity of it!
The Iroquois league was a scourge, a pestilence.
To feel the righteous disdain of an Indian!
You have sold yourself to the Iroquois wolf.
After all, it is only what the Englishman has said.
Monsieur, would you like to see your wife?
Your wife is a queenly woman, monsieur.
From a defiant boy to a court lady!
You forget that I know nothing.
You were an ardent suitor, monsieur.
I put the chair aside and stood over her.
You were needlessly cruel, monsieur.
When you are at leisure, come to my room.
Monsieur Cadillac is waiting for you.
There are never signs till the uprising is on us.
We shall have some scalps first.
With hate in my throat I tried to speak justly.
He has an intelligent mind, but a coward's spirit.
I tell you, you are more a fool than I ever knew.
So I must keep away from the woman.
Go in front of me, I told the Huron.
You think you can overpower us.
If we are to have war, you must begin it.
The commandant is a fool
You were different even three days ago.
Some influence has worked on you here.
Carry my name and do what you will.
You are a strange woman, I said at length.
I put my head back, and breathed hard.
Cadillac does not know one Indian from another.
Montlivet, you cannot understand.
I shall lead the allied force of Indians, monsieur.
No Frenchman's life will be safe.
You are an old man in knowledge, I am a child.
What did it matter if these Indians died!
A great spear had torn through his chest.
And then he found strength to try to push me away.
As well rage at the forces that made him.
I bound him till he was rigid and helpless.
Shall I send Indians with you, too?
When my man calls me I shall go.
And I would have no further words.
I am going out now with Indian trailers.
You are planning a dictatorship.
Montlivet, have you turned priest--or coward?
Do you dare to try and tell me that war is wrong?
He died trying to send me to you.
They found the Indian woman this morning, he said.
Montlivet, one word with your wife first.
I have lived in Indian camps, monsieur.
These chiefs that you see are leaving.
He was not a coward at the last, madame.
I stopped and forced myself to look at her.
I had never seen her look like that.
You do not understand, after all.
You have been gay,--gay at all times.
Monsieur, monsieur, now will you touch my hand?
Madame, you do not know what you are saying.
I have not forgiven you, monsieur.
And then I laid my lips on hers.
She was my own, and I had her there alive.
I wonder if you can understand.
I like to see them act like children.
Oh, you dear papa, I am so tired, so tired!
Good-by, mamma, by, mamma, by, mamma; So up we go!
Good-by, mamma, So early in the evening!
Me do them good
officer, or get out of the service!
Gentlemen, our job has been cut out for us.
Look at the work of Sergeant Mock, will you?
But I want you to stop picking on me.
And if I don't he'll break me, eh?
What's the matter, Mock, don't you like your food?
He's no better than any one else!
That's as healthy a doughboy foot as I've seen.
A doughboy is an infantry soldier.
Tugging his sock on, Mock merely mumbled.
That's enough of this, Mock, he called.
Fix your bayonets, Greg ordered.
Will he do anything more to you?
Don't do anything rash, Cartwright.
Dobson, you be the fleeing enemy this time.
I therefore take this opportunity to rebuke him.
I'd have to be sure you had the nerve.
You're a quitter, I guess, jeered the other.
A German and a German sympathizer!
Did you hear what they said to me?
Oh, I'm sure sick of being in this man's army!
Him an his talk about deserting to the enemy!
Soldiers are like other people in that respect.
Look at that now---the pair of traitors!
On the ground is a good place for you!
What is the matter with you two?
Are you men, or are you dish-rags?
I'm going to fight if I'm told to.
I'm going to do whatever Uncle Sam wants me to do.
The men are doing first-rate for new men.
And I'm glad I'm down here, Prescott retorted.
CHAPTER XII THE BEST OF DETAILS Boom!
French soldiers were becoming more numerous.
My general, you were not hurt by that bomb?
We will now help you to black up.
This trench is no longer German!
It is your last chance for life.
I am neither spy nor traitor, my general!
Since you are a German I can understand anything.
Then bombs fell fast, all along the line.

And you have no blanket if you sleep by yourself.

Gee, but the giant is a coward.
Pa said Well, wouldn't that skin you.
There is no tail on your monkey.
Then you ought to have seen what they did to me.
Pa was the only one that kicked.
You don't mean to rob them, do you?
So it is no wonder to me that the mule kicks.

I'm kinda curious about what's down there m'self.
He's done for, too--no, by God, he isn't!
And why did they do this to you?
You see, one's feelings can change, Sarge.
They tried to make it look like an Indian job.
Hang it, can't you see where I stand?
Why the devil don't you quit the job?
I reverted to Lyn and her affairs.
You lie when you say that, and you know you lie.
Probably they'd cut me, and all that sort of thing.
Come on over to the bull-pen, he invited cordially.
You know what this is, don't you?
That isn't all, he continued moodily.
Hicks might, if you went at him hard enough.
If that stuff is there, it will keep.
Stand behind me, you confounded unbeliever.
Did the black hurt you when he fell?
Bruised my leg some, he returned indifferently.
I'm feeling pretty vacant inside.
Confound them, I wish----Aha, by Jupiter!
Night, black as the bottomless pit, walled us in.
Gone to freighting in your old age?
Not what yuh could notice, I ain't, he snorted.
Catch _me_ whackin bulls for a livin!
You go on to Benton, like a good girl.
And we'll wait here for you unless they jump us up.
Oh, he painted us good and black, I tell you.
Anyway, you'll soon know; he's turning.
Or are they lookin for you fellers?
They ain't seen hide nor hair uh her since.
Aw, don't stand starin at me thataway.
Lessard put Bevans on your trail, Flood.
You're white, if you did get off wrong.

A rank animal odor mingled with the taint of smoke.
Like as not she'd be the first one t get hurt.
I know where there's a good place to get down.
Hicks was gone, and likely to keep going.
I dunno what you're drivin at, Hicks dissembled.
You'll get what's coming to you.
Aha, I told yuh, he cried exultantly.
When we vanish in the smoke we'll take you with us.
Tis you speak, that's your error.
Too far above my people--beneath me!
You need not clap your torches to my face.
I could not paint all night-- Ouf!

I had dropped a lighted match on the bed.
Covey was a poor white and a farm renter.
It was tough for a green boy, but it seasoned him.
You have learned nothing until you are _sure_.
I am acting under such a temperament as that.
Ain't you getting about tired of it?
Now I'm a friend of you boys, ain't I?
The business men insulting the judge in his Club!
He led me into a quiet side room and shut the door.
You'll find you're making a mistake.
Too bad you didn't take that money, he said.
Expert treason, bold and skilful!
Even mild-mannered men called each other names.
A third part died of smallpox on the way.
The Lord keep us in this dark day!
Worse still, he was losing his good name.
And now you tell me he's to be canned.
It's a good thing for you that you kept your head.
As you know, he's a sick man, a very sick man.
Well, that's what lots of the sharps call you.
You don't think you know it all.
I didn't dream you were so shrewd and discerning.
I've got your number, and you know it.
It's plain your sympathy is with the Federals.
If he isn't hanged some day it won't be his fault.
Give me another like that, you little wart!
And I threw him another slow, straight one.
The world is congested with doubters.
I wish you luck, replied Lefty.
I'll give you a chance to see him sagaciate to-day.
I'd like to give him the once over.
Puta the ball over, Left, he pleaded.
Swat it on der trade-mark an clean der sacks.
Dis Lefty boy don't seem such a much.
Put one acrost, pal, an I'll tear der cover off.
Dis Lefty person looks to me like a lemon!
Calm yourself, cap'n, he advised.
You are a base deceiver, Lefty.
He's simply laughing himself sick.
I love to see a man enjoy himself so diabolically.
Then they won't look at you, my happy friend.
Your arm is gone, Locke, and you know it.
You are using language you'll regret!
Turning back, Lefty's eyes followed Jones.
Perhaps he can't keep it up, said Lefty.
You'll be high and dry in a minute.
I cajole with you most deprecatingly.
You can't be sure about that, returned Lefty.
What do you think about it yourself, Lefty?
Accept the offer the Federals have made you.
A train carried Lefty north that night.
T'ink I'll tell youse, old boy.
But then Texas is a big bunch o the map.
I didn't expect to run across you here, old man.
I knew you'd beat me to it, Lefty, he said.
Never heard of such criminal folly!
Decided to have my talk with Lefty first.
Push it at him, and we'll make him sign.
Now don't make a growl, but do as you're wanted.
This time, Lefty, I'm out of the game for good.
Then I'll have to run him down, considered Lefty.
No way-- No way under heaven, take it from me!
You'll get the kicks and the curses.
It was even said he'd gone crazy.
He advised you to--The infernal old scoundrel!
As to that, time will tell, said Lefty.
You don't even know that King's leg is all right.
Frazer wanted Brock, and wanted him bad.
The Feds got after him, and I had to make it that.
You're a regular mule, aren't you?
You won't even meet me halfway, confound you!
What are you two ginks cooking up?
We're going up to make out the papers now.
You've got bats in your belfry!
Why, you've gone clean off your nut!
Don't try to tell me my business.
Allow me a moment to subdue my emotions.
demanded the belligerent individual.
You'd better chase yourself sudden.
You can't put anything like that over on me.
Even Mit Skullen will have the laugh on me.
Wouldn't it congeal your pedal extremities!
Mit's face wore a leering grin.
You've got stung good and proper.
So you would have ducked me, would you?
Hang you for an ungrateful reprobate!
Weegman conceived it, replied Lefty.
Apparently that man is Parlmee.
You'll return, better than ever.
You know what a feud like that means.
You're a wise gazabo, ain't you?
The southpaw laughed in his face.
You fooled yourself that time, Garrity.
Don't tell me what's proper to do!
I had no intention of letting you dictate to me.
You think you're a clever crook.
Weegman snapped his fingers in Locke's face.
Lefty Locke, he mumbled huskily.
He was grinning viciously, triumphantly.
You're welcome to that piece of cheese.
Some baseball manager, that's what you are!
Wasn't he a mut to walk right into this?
And he had been knocked out by him!
Bill went down, knocked senseless.
What are you tryin to put across, bo?
You never were in here before in your life.
Tryin to give my place a bad name?
Nothin like what you say ever happened around here.
You cleaned up in a hurry, said Lefty.
They didn't do you much damage, did they?
This was too much for the southpaw.
It isn't comedy; it's tragedy, Lefty.
I have told him that he is a fool.
Apprehension percheth upon me, Lefty.
He ordered me to keep away from you.
When I found that out I was mad as blazes.
You know what that means for you.
You're just about as trustworthy as a rattlesnake.
You've thrown away your last chance!
You're the fool, Weegman, returned the southpaw.
I'll call in my lawyers, he said.
Garrity rose, his face purple with wrath.
Jordan, a bit unsteady, bored him in the ribs.
Bluff won't mend a busted wing, old boy!
You have your nerve to come to me!
You swore away my liberty, you dog!
Now you have brought justice upon yourself.
6. THE MAKING OF A BIG LEAGUER.
9. LEFTY LOCKE, PITCHER-MANAGER.
I think it was the devil himself.
But there will be none of that, my young whelp!
are you, too, trifling with newspapers!
He must have had too much to drink.
In particular, he was always attacking Trofast.
See what a great big, fine fellow he is.
They shall have their well-merited punishment.
Yours very truly, LAURITZ BOLDEMANN SEEHUS.
Pooh, boys, that was dancing, that was!
Out of the way with these long-shanked flamingoes!
I must stop, for I am growing so angry.
THE PLAY ITS QUALITIES ITS ACTION III.
They are coming, the little sheep.
YNIOLD Where are they going?--Shepherd!
I can no longer see the sky through your locks....
You will feel it in your face....
no, no, not your hand, it might slip....
They always weep in the dark....
They kiss each other sometimes?
No, papa, they do not close their eyes....
Why, what are you afraid of?--look!
I am going to cry, papa!--let me down!
insists Yniold, in nameless terror.
Golaud enters, ferocious and distraught.
I will not have you touch me, do you understand?
They are more than innocent!...
Right, left!--Left, right!--Absalom!
you see, I laugh already like an imbecile!
Their love-scene is harshly interrupted.
If you are afraid, he will go away.
she says
I shall die here like a blind man!
She must live, now, in her place.
And where does poor grandmamma live?
What are you looking for, goody?
I, said the Fly, With my little eye, I saw him die.

But what must they do then, seignior?
says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling.
I no makee Him angry--I no do bad wicked thing.
DIED, on board U.S. Corvette Levant, Lat.
They will have their wish, like him.
There were two Texan officers at the table.
No wonder De Balzac died of heart-disease!
O mothers, ye do make us what ye please!
He found it hard work to gratify these desires.
Thee'd best take her in, Andrew.
H'ist me up her basket here, then.
Innocent as a staggerin calf, that old chap!
says I. Put it to him strong, that way.
It's not victual he's livin on, this day.
Women are the Devil for nerves.
No. Thee'd best go to sleep, lad.
It's yours now, Mr. Starke, d y understand?
I do not need anything, my good boy.
Jest as prim an sober as you see.
He eat nothin then: I seen that.
Sleep your thick sleep, and go your drowsy way!
It is the gay confidence of youth.
ADDRESSED TO ANDREW JACKSON BROWN.
Only I really think I nailed the beggar.
Certainly--to get another burro.
I'll call your bluff, she challenged.
We'll see if you're four-flushing.
Only another Apache can do that.
Now's your chance to quit--your last chance.
Look ahead, Miss Farley--all bare and open!
An Indian can lope along all day, like a coyote.
The other had been emptied into Lennon's face.
With your hand useless, we can't fight.
If you'd leave me here--I'm only a drag.
I know now for sure you're a man, a real man!
If they are at all like you, Carmena!
Only---- You'll learn all too soon!
You have risked your own life just to save mine.
And get the rest of the bunch down on us!
They kiss each other--sometimes.
Why hasn't she taken you and your Dad?
Mena's were even rawer--awful bad.
She says that's all it's good for.
Haven't you any sense any more, Cochise?
You had your chance and missed it.
Now, is it fight, or do you back up?
The others must have died of thirst.
And was all the brown of her skin on the outside?
Isn't she just too sweet for anything!
You mean he's your man--tips you off--all that?
You swap my woman for him, I let him go now.
Maybe you'll let him go anyway, _amigo_.
Like the Indians, Elsie is still scared of them.
Slade laughs at Indian spirits.
That's a Federal penitentiary offense!
The stones will double the destruction.
So's you'd get mad and fight Cochise, of course.
Quite in keeping with the burro.
Why, cause you couldn't fight, of course.
He was very white and shaky but rational.
Watch your bad arm, Mr. Lennon, she advised.
Slade doesn't enjoy being made to wait.
But you heard what your daughter said.
Good thing for us your bark's worse'n your bite.
Can you wonder I think he's a man for us to tie to?
He's beginning to bristle up even to you.
Pulled his knife on me, did he?
She sure got that tenderfoot roped mighty slick.
But at least he's not an Indian, Mena says.
I am going to keep you--always.
What are you doing, Jack Lennon?
Oh, Mena, please, please don't be cross with Jack!
Merely knocked out--worse luck!
Bad as he is, he's a white man.
When he tired of Blossom, he'd give her to his men.
Loosen your clothes, she whispered in Lennon's ear.
I'm going back to bed to sleep it off.
I will come back and take you away.
The sooner they leave the better.
You act like an old-timer on a gold stampede.
You must figger I'm plumb loco.
She did not belong and never would.
Have you--what do you call it?--gone loco?
You will now apologize for that term you used.
The look in his eye was unmistakable.
We'll see what Cochise can do to make you behave.
You're one of these here science sharps, he jeered.
Why split the twenty with a dam Apache?
I'd a give him Carmena quick enough....
The big missile grazed past the dodger.
You and my Cookie Gal better hustle up some feed.
Don't figger I want _you_ any more, do you?
Looks like they plugged you pretty bad.
Oh, you can't--you can't be so heartless!
Guess you wish you hadn't, he jeered.
As he lived, so he had died--futilely.
Think you can bribe me, do you?
He seized Lennon and dragged him out.
You have only to---- _Basta._ Him big devil.
You say you no care what become of you.
Dam friend--you, jeered the Indian.
Her ankles had already been freed.
He turned away from the girl, full of loathing.
Slade swear you hide my woman, he said.
He had me tied up and lowered to you.
He was up here with her all that time.
You find my woman quick, I let you go.
I've been a fool--a blind fool.
And you're not my mamma, no more than he's my papa.
Of course we're not your papa and mamma.
The bad Indian was chasing our ponies.
I found your papa and mamma and buried them.
You look at me like mamma does.
Dad was an Easterner like yourself.
Then he forced tizwin making upon us.
You would have given your life--and more.
You glory of the desert--you cactus blossom!
Would not you have him locked up?
You cannot be ignorant of this.
Feel, touch, come into contact, I replied.
I do not in the least understand you.
Can anything be more irrational or audacious?
Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions.
Have you felt me enough by this time?
(TO HIMSELF.) I can do neither.
Why will you refuse to listen to reason?
But trust me, your wise men are wrong.
But these are the qualities of women!
Arrest the policemen
I. Thine interior: thy stomach, thy intestines.
Deny it, and I am henceforth silent.
I want to inthrodooce mesilf to him!
I have a bitter plan than that.
We're no longer in the United States.
You're foolish to loiter along the road like this.
HE EXCLAIMED.] No mistake, it is.
No; it cannot be, he said in a husky voice.
It was a gruff Hands up, younker!
Are you going to sit here all day, little girl?
Your mother will be looking for you.
Tell us now, that's a good girl.
May be you will find a tongue down there.
Then tell me your mother's name.
he asked, looking down with a smile.
Well, what do you say, little girl?
If anyone claims her he can find her there.
He loved little girls, and was also fond of cats.
They gave you a bath, didn't they?
Where are you going, little girl?
She must need some little girl.
When I come back I want you to be all ready for me.
No little girl can leave her clothes like this.
Poor child, she must be a sad case.
Don't you remember your mother's name?
So she pulled off her clothes, and got into bed.
You'd better eat what you have.
You see, miss, she's of no use to me.
You won't ever, will you, Debby?
Not a single thing, except this picture.
She is too big for us to care for now.
You'd better keep quiet, you old pig!
Perhaps this will be a lesson to you.
He looked at her tongue, and felt her pulse.
He felt her pulse, and looked her all over.
I will take care of her tonight.
She will need great care tonight, I think.
Do you feel better now, dear little girl?
Oh, now dearie, I wouldn't be doing that.
she asked, finding her tongue at last.
Squeal away, piggies, said Mr. Alder.
No, but they were all here last night.
You turn around and shut your eyes.
They are good for little city girls.
I wonder if she caught any rats.
And here is a lady, too, he added.
We'll have to shut her up in the loft.
Two weeks seems a long, long time to little girls.
Never mind, dear little girl, he said.
She must be around here somewhere.
I wonder where she can be hiding.
Why, little girl, where did you come from?
Do you think you would like that?
You incongruous Old Woman of Smyrna!
So they smashed that Old Man with a gong.
Which distracted that virulent Bull. 74.
It is four times as big as the bush!
That mendacious Old Person of Gretna.
That provoking Young Lady of Parma.
You invidious Old Man of Aosta!
That's foolish--and sentimental--and impossible.
You haven't yet mentioned one very important thing.
You never heard me NICKNAME a minister.
But then I never did whip you, did I, Paul?
You know, Anne, you did treat Roy very badly.
You can't have seen her, or you would remember her.
I meant to have a spanking good dinner today.
Nothing a dog'd care for, that is.
Like meself, he might be a real beauty inside.
His language was right down forcible.
Some folks are like that, if you've noticed.
You are a beautiful sewer, Miss Bryant.
He said he wanted to have the training of her.
We made a mistake when we called HIM.
Lord, dearie, I don't hate them.
Uncle Dave is a little prejudiced, I think.
He wants tales that reek with gore.
It's politics that's at the bottom of his freak.
I like to see folks cry that way, he remarked.
Here was another unbelievable thing.
It's no secret--the OUTSIDE, that is.
I won't BE kept at a distance, believe ME!
Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl!
He hadn't memory or intellect or reason.
He's just like a child, no more nor less.
She must have taken to you real strong.
Just get her to come over here as often as she can.
Don't be too long going to see her either.
There ain't no question in my mind about THAT.
She's just wasted here--wasted.
I'm so glad we left it burning.
It must have been a real pleasant change for her.
I could have had him long ago when he was fresh.
They deserved it too--a pack of incapables.
Oh, it's well that women are patient, believe ME!
Even you can't defend his wife.
She made him walk Spanish, believe me!
He had one for me when he come down tonight.
I wish you all the best year of your lives, mates.
The worse you are the sooner you'll stop, mebbe.
When I was a boy there was a-plenty of it.
Most of em blunder to Him after awhile, I guess.
Geordie hain't got THAT far yet.
I'd gladly give my life for THAT!
Susan doesn't like it very well.
That's exactly what I am--a hateful little beast.
But I hadn't--I hadn't--and it didn't seem FAIR.
I--I hated you more then than I've ever done since.
You are NOT hateful or jealous or envious.
I used just to look up at her in worship.
She'll have more to do when her boarder comes.
Your grandmother shines like a star in his memory.
And it isn't altogether pleasant for her, either.
It'd make a cat laugh, Jim Boyd, says he.
You will catch a t'ousand dis afternoon.
A woman with eyes like yours always understands.
You seem to have a cold in the head.
If it comes to that, whatever are YOU doing here?
Oh, is it written in my face for everyone to see?
Or do you think I'm just plain fool?
Oh, I don't know--you and Gilbert are such CHUMS.
Anne, this world is an awful place, believe me.
She's almost buried alive over there.
Oh, Gilbert, I CAN'T think you are right.
I dunno's you're any the worse for it.
Gilbert, I've been rather hateful over this.
That's just what it is--an iniquitous shame.
The devil was in him, believe ME!
She combs me down every time I encounter her.
Anne, I'll shake you if you don't grow coherent.
Redmond would be ashamed of you.
No matter what they do, it's the wrong thing.
It must be very strange for him, poor fellow.
I'm not glad or sorry--or ANYTHING.
He has his own place, my dear, wee man-child.
Just see the dimples in his elbows.
Didn't you know you took your life in your hands?
Susan is not the woman to burn a wee man.
And she had continued to violate it ever since.
It comes natural--and it's RIGHT.
God knew what He was about when He made you.
Leslie, you are an adorable goose.
Now, go right to bed and have a good sleep.
I can't get to the bottom of that affair.
And not one whit concerned about it was he!
Not I. Marshall will live me out.
Now, do not you cry and spoil your pretty eyes.
Yes, and it is said that he is not much of a man.
Where the devil can not go, he sends a woman.
On the contrary, it was a deep offense to her.
It is a bad wife a man must lie to.
Every man loves in his own way.
Jan does nothing well but he spoils it.
Go thy ways before I curse thee.
Go and see them, it will be good for thee.
He gave the facts to Snorro in an apathy.
Nay, then he will think that I am a coward.
Shall I lose my child to save Jan Vedder?
Tell Jan he must not come here.
Tell him I will not, dare not, see him!
Go away, Snorro, lest worse words come.
Ask Margaret if that is her last word to me?
Is Jan's loss all thy grief, Snorro?
I said some angry words for thee.
He liked to see his crew watch Jan.
I would not have her suffer, my friend.
And I will not have thee come crying here.
I have spared thee long enough.
When did I say evil of thee, only to thy face?
Michael Snorro hath but one tongue.
Wherever Jan is, that land is best of all.
Oh, miserable, unworthy wife that I have been!
What a selfish woman I must be!
Little wonder that he despised me!
I have deserved to be forgotten.
Thy loving husband, JAN VEDDER.
No, it would have been bad for thee.
Well, then, he is just like thee!
Cursed be he that giveth unto the rich.
Ay, I would leave thee, mother.
Well, Jan, Osman was a very bad man.
My minister, he was a devil and no man.
You have to, unless the Ford does; and Fords don't.
I'll drive em till their tongues hang out.
Oh, all right, if that's the way yuh feel.
And so I pounded er on the tail, coming down.
I'll eat a bite before I take her up.
You think I'm scared to tell her what happened?
Whadda I want a wife for, anyway?
Then I can leave this bleatin burro with Bill.
No, sir, Casey Ryan never back-trailed yet.
Casey's goin to step high, wide and handsome.
Mister, you're a godsend, if ever there was one.
We'll get you outa here in no time.
You're smokin back there like wet wood.
Jack, dear, can you believe your nose!
Junior, darling, just smell the bacon!
Go give him a kiss like a little man.
Mah-mal Do we have to p-pay that there g-godsend?
C-can you p-pay for more b-bacon for me, mah-ma?
The dog-gone helpless, starved bunch!
You don't want nothin of Vegas.
Lund's the place you want to hit fer.
They were not fools, by the way.
Now what to do beats me, Mister.
And they was going to send us to jail!
Jack's tone was arrogant past belief.
I'll plug her so they can't ring her.
You can't down the Irish for very long.
I'm going to ketch that evenin train to Los.
Now look what it done to me, Bill!
I don't back down from runnin anything.
That's your weakness, Casey, and you know it.
You and the road they got to travel.
A Ford's like a mule or a burro.
It's kinda hard on the tourists, don't yuh think?
She's a tough one, from here on to the next stop.
It's lucky I got your size, at that.
Twelve, not countin the little fellers.
They ain't had a drop sence early yest-day mornin.
He could still be happy-- _What_ yuh doin that for?
He had to, you see, or go crazy.
I'll trade yuh goats fer tires.
Nope, said Casey wearily, I don't want yer goats.
I've had more goats a'ready than I want.
You c'n see that much fer yourself.
Yessir, wouldn't buy tires off me, even!
But I got even with im, he added.
It's the devil out walkin an packin a lantern.
An t'-morra, if yuh like, I'll take yuh over there.
You come inside where yuh can't watch it.
Into that gruesome Crevice, for instance.
Now it was going to be a fight.
Your squaw says you want tobacco.
Yo bringum heap jam, bringum shirt.
He was very mean with me all the time.
I think I will have you for my friend.
Do not talk to my mother, Hahnaga.
She tells lies all the time about me.
Indians don't know what money is good for.
I think you want that gold mine awful bad.
If a man is poor he don't care.
I ain't going to commence on an old squaw.
I think Hahnaga will dig a grave.
Then you will buy me-- I'll buy you nothin!
Then I hate you and I will fix you good!
You want that gold mine awful bad.
A squaw with no education would have got forthwith.
As ever your friend, Yours truly, LUCY LILY.
An Indian does not like to stay where one has died.
All time tellum heap big lie so Indian no likeum.
I was foolish enough to argue with him.
And that's what I'm kickin about!
Casey Ryan ain't the man to let it stop there.
Now will you tie Joe's naughty hands jus like that?
Come over here and don't bother the gentleman.
I'm Casey Ryan that's speakin to yuh.
He'd gone fifty feet when he died.
Casey Ryan, come back here and listen to me.
What are you laughing at, Casey Ryan?
Tell me about the little ol Frenchman.
Oh, yes; very explicit, I admit.
You couldn't tell me nothin I wouldn't believe!
This ain't a bad canyon to prospect in.
Mebby you forgot the place, and mebby yuh didn't.
I'll go catch your wainbow, Casey Wyan.
I'll run fas as I can, an I'll catch it for you!
You pack that kid all the way over here?
That name won't mean nothin to em.
Mother will be compelled to tie a rope on you.
Poor Casey Wyan forgot--his bacco!
What's mineral-bearing wock, mother?
You'll see soon enough, Jeremy.
You'll be lonesome, too, if I mistake not.
He's terrible to watch when he's raised.
You're big and strong, an may make a foremast hand.
Why he never knifed me, after, I don't know.
They'll never stand for what he's done.
Pharaoh Daggs don't love us a mite.
She's British, right enough, he was saying.
and his voice trailed off in crazy laughter.
A dozen faces surrounded him, glaring angrily.
Leave em to starve or drown on a sinkin ship!
Sneak off like a dog an a son of a cowardly dog!
Pharaoh Daggs, step forward and unloose the rope!
Daggs, I leave the boy in your charge.
Now get below, the pair of you.
It was his old shipmate, Bill Curley, the Jamaican.
Now look alive--every one of you!
Right there, she'll be, he muttered.
Every man fell fighting and died sword in hand.
She's at your service, he smiled.
He offered me the chance to command her!
It was Pharaoh Daggs and none other.
Well, he grinned, the heavier the better!
Ever seen this gal afore, Jeremy?
Finally I said to myself, Here, don't be a fool!
Try it some time with your hands tied!
No cannikin was skimped while I was at the spigot.
Put your helm hard down and bring her to the wind!
Don't she look sort o soggy to you?
See there, now, when she lifts!
No wonder they're trying to beach her!
Then, Bring her head to the wind, Hawkes!
BETWEEN CHARYBDIS AND SCYLLA 291 XLI.
ESPERANCE, MONTE-CRISTO'S SON 397 LVII.
MONTE-CRISTO, THE MARTYR 468 LXIX.
The Sultan is living and has been here!
In a moment I was securely bound and gagged.
I have you now, and you shall die!
Maldar and his ruffians are there!
Monsieur Fongereues, do you hear?
We shall be the masters now, mamma, shall we not?
You come from Germany, do you not?
He was taught from his cradle to hate France.
the invasion will then take that direction!
I knew by their caps that they were Russians.
We shall take it by force, then!
I felt that Talizac was enough for us to hate.
Here, Michel, dig out this place with your bayonet!
They fired at me, and wounded me in the head.
The scene was an absolute butchery.
Now lie down, my boy, and get a little sleep.
He poured his flask of powder on the floor.
my lad, you made a great mistake.
Just let her lay a finger on the girl, that is all!
I mean to get rid of him for reasons of my own.
you have come, children, have you?
Not for long, you had better believe!
Why do you call me little sister?
If any one questions you, make no reply.
Sir, he said to me, a Fongereues never begs!
Throw your cards on the table, Cyprien!
Don't get into any trouble, papa would be offended.
I think, Robeccal, you are trying to provoke me.
Will you never learn any sense.
Iron Jaws placed himself on this platform.
Fanfar himself could hardly stand.
He never goes out, this hermit.
But my master did not yield, nor will I!
I refuse--the son of Simon de Fongereues is living!
You will get your punishment in another world!
Why do you meddle in what does not concern you?
The clown was crying like a baby.
And now, good people, I must ask you to leave me.
Do you wonder that Fanfar hates the Bourbons?
Come out with me, said this man.
I am ready to serve your--son-- My son!
I am not so simple, sir, as you think.
The police are coming to arrest you!
That may be, but I have orders to arrest these men!
Gentlemen, he said, this man has insulted me.
Now go--return to your shameful pleasures!
Friends, defenders of the Monarchy and of Religion.
And this has been going on for two months!
You bear too much from this girl!
They resisted every offer and every threat he made.
The people down stairs won't stand any nonsense!
They are young men, are they not?
And he tried to take her by the waist.
Don't meddle in what does not concern you.
he cried, they are insulting a poor girl up-stairs.
sneered Cyprien, the king has his eyes on you!
Fanfar caught him, but it was too late.
I will go to her and question her.
She has been carried off, by a man named Talizac.
He recognizes her
But you want to see her, do you?
Why does the girl sleep like this?
and the giantess clenched her enormous fist.
I would crush her to jelly if she did!
It is too late, little girl, too late!
Your lover was here with you all night!
child, it is useless for you to try!
The two wretches gasped out the names: Fanfar!
This is what your son has done, Marquis!
What does this senseless comedy mean?
And I, sir, swear that he speaks the truth!
In the name of the king, I arrest you!
I have been cowardly toward him.
She has been abducted by the Vicomte de Talizac.
cried the clown, with much of his former gayety.
Peace means fortune and power, and war-- War!
repeated Fongereues, I do not understand you.
I an adversary of the Society of Jesus!
What have you, his mother, done for him?
Fongereues laughed hysterically.
Now, why did you poison Fanfar?
A second later and Fanfar would have been no more!
You will gag him, added Vidocq, it is better.
he cried, gayly, come here, and look out!
The only thing for Fanfar is to flee the country.
Yes, sir, while you were asleep.
I shall not die until she comes.
Suddenly she drew me to her, kissed me, and died.
I am rich, I know, but it is not my fault.
You millionaires know nothing of life.
you know that I always work in the evening.
Goutran had indeed behaved very strangely to her.
You are walking into a snare laid for you.
You have behaved like a hero, Count!
Maslenes gently pushed her back.
Some one must have insulted you!
Pray, try and control yourself.
No, sir, you will do nothing of the kind.
And that witness must be yourself.
You are planning some new villainy.
You can have nothing more to say to me.
Not another word like that, Benedetto!
No, he said, finally, I refuse.
The fool has signed his own name!
There she will lead a new life!
The pretty blonde is the one I mean.
Sanselme remained alone with the corpse.
He would wait until the priest came up.
He did not know what she required.
For Heaven's sake, sir, be quiet!
That is none of your affairs, sir.
If my mother wakes you will call me.

Danglars, do you wish to see this man suffer?
You are right--and I, like you, hate him!
Then, said Danglars, I join you, for I hate him!
You have suffered, but now all that is over.
Esperance, you little know what is going on!
This woman is right, but I never did her any harm.
Sanselme, you have been a great criminal.
For five long years I endured this martyrdom.
For some time I have hated and loathed Laisangy.
I am hardly foolish enough for that.
Your life is indeed mine, and I mean to have it.
Esperance did not reply to this insulting question.
Upon my life, said Coucon, this is bad enough.

And a drink is good also
And as for my looks, they are all right....
Black as my boot, fierce as a dog, and eyes ...
They will seize thee immediately.
but, nevertheless, what outrageous conduct!
As you see--I am digging a grave for myself.
Because I do not wish to live any longer.
Are not you the cause of it all?...
So down with everything,--and with me also!
The devil knows the meaning of this!
Really, you have no cause for this.

No, he is not green, but black.
No, he is like a man,--only all black.
Wait, wait, Yakoff, do not lose thy courage.
I'm not far from laying hands on myself, as it is.
I won't go to her, says he, not on any account!
And what do you think?--My Yasha was asleep!
The next day I see Yakoff take his cap....
I did so; I spat it out, and ground it under foot.
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!

worst of all, so artificial ...
Either this is all nonsense ...
It must be some drama or other.
But now I want to go to bed and sleep.
Consequently I must die in order to be with her?
from which I inferred that she was blind.
I bend down to her face, to her eyes....

I saw you mooning about with it last night, Tom.
You know, you get em every day!
Any fool knows that, eh, Peachey?
As if they'd go there if they did n't want to!
Put him in my dressing-room, I'll turn out.
I'll sleep with the poor creatures.
Nonsense, I won't have Peachey---- MRS.
Oh, Uncle Tom, your head is so beautiful from here!
you've got all your troubles before you.
[Bitterly.] He's such a cool beast.
When he comes I might just as well go to bed.
[Releasing a worm.] Letting the poor creatures go.
[Grimacing.] The Colonel's getting licked.
[Quietly.] It makes me sick, young man.
Look what she's got behind her, sly old thing!
[Panting.] Dance, dance with the poor young man!
[Whispering.] She's been letting out your worms.
[Scornfully.] You don't understand!
[Violently.] I wish----Promise, Joy!
[Whispering.] Pay her out, pay her out!
Letty's your wife, she'd say anything.
[Staring at him.] You're a--you're aa theorist!
[To LETTY.] Where's your mother?
[He goes, and ROSE is left alone.] ROSE.
[Looking at her intently.] Joy!
Fussing about somewhere
Go and tell your aunt your mother's on the lawn.
She goes on at me till she gets on my nerves.
All very well for you to laugh, Molly!
D you mean to say that's all you've got, Uncle Tom?
[Feelingly.] It is a d--d shame!
I don't pay the slightest attention to her.
Mind, I think you've been very rash.
I'm going to put Mr. Lever in your room.
Ernie, be careful, you never know where Joy is.
[Seizing her, she turns her back on LEVER.
[MISS BEECH, grunts slightly.] COLONEL.
Now Molly, I'm simply asking---- MRS.
[In a low voice.] It's hateful here.
[Losing her control.] Can't you SEE?
[And she does not look at him.] LEVER.
What bothers me now is your Uncle.
I'd no business to tell even you.
if you're going to take it like this, Molly MRS.
Of course, I'll speak to your Uncle.
I ll do anything you want---- MRS.
[Suddenly clinging to her.] Oh!
I want to get you to--he--he s--he snot----!
Let's tell Uncle Tom, Mother, and go away.
[Through her teeth.] I hate him.
I didn't mean to listen, but I hate him.
Let's tell Uncle Tom and go away from him?
D you think they'll do her any good?
[Gloomily.] But this is too brutal for anything!
You'd better go in and get yourself a partner.
[Ironically.] Poor lot, are n't they?
You're lucky to be down here, Molly.
so you think she's lucky, do you?
Got too excited about your coming.
You don't understand her, Peachey.
If I were her mother I'd soon have her up.
Have her up with that headache!
I'd raging neuralgia for two days.
It s only puttin off the evil day.
With your Aunt it's me, and by George!
Don't do that, old girl, it makes me wretched.
[With a violent effort.] It's all right, Uncle Tom!
[MISS BEECH wipes her own eyes stealthily.
[Motionless.] Life's very hard on women!
You don't care if it ends for me!
Peachey, go in and leave me alone.
They make way for each other.] LEVER.
I've made it all right with your Uncle.
[She throws her scarf off.] LEVER.
Are you all right now, darling?
[Taking her wrist.] Was it was it your Mother?
[Releasing her.] I'm thinking of your Mother, Joy.
We ve been hateful to each other for years.
Don't cover your face like a child--look at me.
I would do anything for you, Mother.
Oh, Mother, I wouldn't, I never would, I swear it.
If it's wicked, I shall pay for it, not you!
But I want to save you, Mother!
You think I'm a monster to hurt you.
[Looking

We only know when we're uncomfortable.
You'll please to do nothing of the kind.
You'll keep it to cover your poor old legs.
I call him my sick-nurse because he's sick himself.
But I suppose you can't help it.
You've no excuse for being bored anywhere.
You must have developed very late.
You think too much of your pleasure.
But you've never learned the things they don't say!
I'll keep him while I'm here, with pleasure.
Yes
No, you don't look like a person of that sort.
She ought to marry an Armenian or a Portuguese.
I don't think she finds me one.
Natural people are not the most trouble.
No, said Ralph; you yourself are a proof of that.
Oh, I know your mother; she's not romantic.
I infer also that you like my mother.
So you adore her--out of perversity?
Oh no
Heaven deliver me from my friends!
Ah, he couldn't be a martyr even if he wished!
Is it true your brother's such a great radical?
Is England not good enough for you?
Then you'll go on judging, I suppose.
You only care to amuse yourself.
You think she's capable of it then?
There's intellectual poverty for you.
The more shame to you
My dear lady, I have no conscience!
You'll need it the next time you go to America.
That's because you truckle to them.
Did she think I was making love to her?
You like her then for patriotic reasons.
He'll find you changed, the latter pursued.
You needn't be a better royalist than the king.
Americans are highly appreciated.
You didn't find it sufficiently attractive?
It's true they're nice fresh free-born Americans!
You're in love with yourself, that's the Other!
I'll be Caliban and you shall be Ariel.
I suppose you know she comes from there.
She can't help it, but she does.
I've watched her and I can see it.
I don't care anything about his name.
If you say that to pour scorn on me I don't care.
I believe you are
But you're always looking away.
You're afraid of meeting my eye.
Is her position inferior to yours?
And then you know we're very dull.
I think that's so very wrong of you.
I'm determined to get some satisfaction out of you.
You'd be careful not to like her enough.
Miss Archer has been warning you!
I'm sure you act well
You're fine enough and you're not too fine.
I don't know but what she'd be too fine for me.
Capital thing to have your future so handy.
What do you care for my feeble attempts?
That's what your mother thinks too.
I refused him because he was too perfect then.
I'm not perfect myself, and he's too good for me.
We shall hang on the rest of your career.
There are other things a woman can do.
You're the most charming of polygons!
Men do so with a certain frequency.
You've no right to talk of losing what's not yours.
Men don't understand such things.
Plenty of men will try to make you.
Do you accuse me of lying to shake you off?
I'm after all very much afraid of you.
And pray isn't an Englishman a human being?
You'll get very sick of your independence.
I don't believe Annie was pressed
You're drifting to some great mistake.
That's why I don't return to America.
I don't want a new interest, daddy.
She does it because it suits her.
It's as if she came over on purpose.
It's just the same with your bad lung.
Young men are very different from what I was.
Do you think that she's a girl to do that?
Well, dear daddy, don't you understand it now?
She's never the least little bit off.
I don't envy them trying to arrange themselves.
There are young men and young men.
Pardon me, I understand her perfectly.
But for the present she's simply stupefied.
You can't go anywhere unless you come here first.
You don't think you'd like that?
But you do think I'm obstinate and narrow-minded?
And you, my sister, are French, said the gentleman.
Le couvent n'est pas comme le monde, monsieur.
Little girls usually dislike them.
I call YOUR life your ambitions, said Osmond.
You're not selfish--I can't admit that.
For me that's your worst fault.
The word niece suggests youth and ignorance.
But you won't be able to help it.
She fills all your requirements.
I'm not so heartless as you think.
There are some things you'll never understand.
They're really so much better than most people's.
Satisfactory woman!--I mean you.
And if I go to see her shall I see the mother?
What could he be more asinine than that?
I like what they've made of her.
Used to them, I mean, so as to despise them.
I don't think I recommend you to know her.
Judge everyone and everything for yourself.
She's a capital person for you to know.
Poor Osmond, with his old curtains and crucifixes!
The more you know the more unhappy you are.
Perhaps you think that's even worse.
I see that just now you DON'T wish.
You're capable of anything, you and Osmond.
To be sacrificed, any girl would do.
In other words she's an insipid little chit.
I think she likes the poor child.
The better you like her the better for me.
You're afraid you'll see too much of me.
You may be unhappy, but you shall not make ME so.
Do you mean what more does SHE?
Have you lost your wits entirely?
Do you call us of Hamilton plantation a rabble?
We are not known as Minute Boys!
Yes, chile, Silber Heels is wid de res.
Did you speak with my mother, Saul?

little Frenchie asked with a smile.
Don stop to fight, kase it won't be any use.
Ay, that I am, was my angry reply.
Thinking you would tire me out, eh?
Perhaps I am not good enough for such as you?
I dare do what any other lad may.
What has happened since I have been shut up yonder?
I done roll him ober, chile, I done roll him ober.
He was bleeding from a cut on the face.
So you belong on the Hamilton plantation, do you?
Dere's gwine to be no retreatin dis yere night.

Remember that our lives depend upon your aim.
Nor did she ever don any other.
Go get yourself some working clothes!
Take off your black velvet and gold!
You don't understand, Buster tried to explain.
Then you ate it yourself, Rusty Wren faltered.
She can't be any busier than I am.
She can't do that, he explained.
Maybe it's her clothes that make her look strange.
For all I know, you may be dissembling.
She's too big for me to handle.
If she does, I'll have fun with her.
You'll injure her if you're too rough with her.
I wouldn't harm a hair of her head!
He found her too rough to suit him.
She knocks me down whenever I meet her.
And she wouldn't have come out for anything.
Why, she has more children than she can count.
She can't even keep her own tongue from wagging!
She had a very sharp tongue, herself.
You're going to live in a pumpkin!
You're going to live in the haystack.
She was smooth and shiny herself.
Can't hurt a husky man like you.

I have found the attraction already, fair mistress.
We shall see when Morice comes, she retorted.

Yes, I. Do not fear that I lie to you, child.
They were angry that you were not here.
Oh, no. He returned to Kernak last night.
Is that the reason you flout my lord?
He is not bad, only weak, like Morice.
I hate him, and yet he frightens me.
Gabrielle covered her face with her hands, moaning.
They told me you were a traitor, she said.
He is a cursed aristo
We will deal with him according to justice.

Stap me, sir, but you take it coolly, quoth he.
The speaker's tone was yet more insolent.
Do not lose your temper, I implore you, sir.

I was tired, and slept like a dog.
I accept it, said the Dictator.
It was an old lady dressed in black.
You must be so tired, my dear, so very tired.
The wretches, the wicked wretches!
Why, you would be as bad as I used to be, he said.
Why, said Miss Ericson, what nonsense this is!
He smiled back at the white gentleman.
Let me see much of you now that you have come back.
I guess that always appeals to you.
I think he was a Portuguese originally.
What was he like, mentally, physically, every way?
I beg your pardon, ma'am, he said.
Doesn't a strong man always get to the front?
Made themselves nasty, answered Hiram.
I don't want compliments
Do you think I can't understand?
When Gloria calls me to go back to her I will go.
And he only said, Oh, nonsense!
Oh, come now!--the Dictator, of course.
But you can't want to miss your Dictator?
I am so sorry, the Dictator said.
But what is the use if she is not coming?
I do not care to vex myself about them.
Everything is taken with easy ridicule.
It isn't even London social life.
I shall do nothing of the kind!
They are, I dare say, the Dictator said carelessly.
She must be, the Dictator said earnestly.
I shall be delighted, the Dictator replied.
but you are looking bad, child!
Is he going back to his own country?
It isn't common sense, you know.
You two would be quite enough, I dare say.
Dear young lady, you challenge me like a sentry.
I want to look after the Dictator.
perhaps of her more especially.
Some gents are so stuck-up, don't you know.
I have come from South America.
You hain't nothin to do with me.
Down in the East End, don't you know?
Look here, Sarrasin said, angrily interfering.
Answer the lady at once, you confounded scoundrel!
Now get away--and set us free from your presence.
Very likely, the Dictator said carelessly.
It is of no use, the Dictator said.
I begin to be afraid about myself now.
You are right, boy, the Dictator cheerily said.
No fear of that, boy, the Dictator said.
Dear old boy, what _is_ the matter with you?
And Professor Flick is just as bad.
I'll go and see her after this act.
Men can always find companionship.
You are too good, Mr. Ericson, too good.
A very good idea, said the Dictator.
I have my cab outside, the Dictator said.
As he drove he was thinking over the Americans.
I suppose so, the Dictator answered.
You would not understand, of course.
Come, you are only laughing at me.
I see, the Dictator said with a smile.
Do you come from the Southern States, Professor?
I am a sort of Spaniard, you know.
Lick and Flick are so much alike.
And I don't know one little bit about sciences.
It's absurd to make such a fuss about this fellow.
You fool!--and you answered her in Spanish?
Good heavens, what a fool you are!
Copping asked fiercely, standing up.
I smoke here every night, and Sarrasin too, mostly.
But he left them to imprisonment for life.
Come what will, I know I am not a coward!
I want to get at your own knife.
Have you your senses about you?
The Dictator said these words with a purpose.
Copping whispered ferociously into his ear.
You are always bullying me, the big man whimpered.
Now I am getting sick of all that, don't you see?
No you don't--you bet you don't!
Until I have won my fight, and can claim you.
She was clinging around his neck.
And I am very glad you did, papa!
took me into his room and left us.
What does it matter, now I'm dying?
Was she young and lovely, or was she getting on?
It is really providential that I am what I am.

You said you had them on you day and night.
Won't be bothered any more about them.
You insult _me_ in insulting my friend, sir.
You have done it now, and no mistake.
He was making himself worse every moment.
You are going to your uncle in Dublin, are not you?
I don't think she can be coming at all.
Is it about what happened last night?
I hate Ralph to see me with red eyes.
Middleton, you had better go back in the cart.
I don't think you will get on, sir.
He was a foreigner, and no mistake.
Why, you ain't never going yet?
No
Why do you have pins in your mouth, Mrs. Jones?
We shall get there first, because he is lame.
You have found it for yourself.
He's not a common donkey, she said, with pride.
What a round of gayety Molly's life is!
I was spoiled as a child, and look at me!
He is handsome, too, in his foreign way.
You are not going away, are you?
Men did not, of course, care for him so much.
Drive slowly under these trees, Dare.
Then I take no more punch in the future.
From a gell I suffered in my inside.
I'm worse than Raca, as Molly said.
I don't think he made himself so.
You intend to refuse me, I can see.
And all the while you were engaged to another man!

Now I have as good as told you.
She might as well finish it now.
Hesitate, and it will be too late!

Would she believe this vile calumny?

THE CRIME OF SYLVESTRE BONNARD.
The Translation and Introduction by LAFCADIO HEARN.
THE ARMY CORPS--HAS NOT LEFT ENGLAND!
All will be done that man can do.
Not for your side: that I cannot wish you.
No Boers are to be seen talking to Englishmen.
_Brown-faced man._ Free State, same as you do.
Every loyal man in South Africa knows them.
Do not forget, either, the doctors of the enemy.
And now what does it feel like to be bombarded?
Then they went out and counted the corpses--230.
We are learning lessons every day from the Boer.
You squirm between iron fingers.
And the men had all gone to earth, of course.
Interred in Ladysmith Cemetery at midnight.
I don't believe one word of ancient history.
No. Oh well, you won't care to see it.
I guess it'll be better if she doesn't come now.
Change seats with me, boy, he said.
Did you ever talk to a lunatic?
Say, you won't tell mother, will you?
You'll curl up and die if you do that, he said.
You simply can't do it, that's all.
She's saved it all for me, boy.
You don't know what you are doing.
And you want me to be accessory to your--crime.
He drew her in and shut the door.
You haven't a thing to do with it, Porter.
Silly---- You say that, but you don't mean it.
The General chuckled, She'll do.
I know a gentleman when I see one, Porter.
He loved your mother and missed her.
And all the rest of us are as poor as poverty.
You wouldn't want me that way, Porter.
I've had enough scolding for one day.
But in the end I'm going to--win.
Perhaps he was already her accepted lover.
And yet you've never lived your own life.
And she'll shrivel to his measure of her.
Barry always turned it out when he came.
It isn't your brother, he said.
For one night he would let himself go.
His pulses throbbed as he watched her.
Whittington shall marry her, marry her, marry her!
It isn't a mood with you, it's your life.
But I'd rather die fighting than smothered.
Tell me now and get the agony over.
Barry, Mary expostulated, behave yourself.
And it isn't just that he is irresponsible.
You haven't the training or the experience.
she asked, and she seemed breathless.
Please don't think I'm a coward, she begged.
There will always be some one to fight yours.
Take it off and let me look at your eyes.
Make a weak man strong, I mean?
I'm not saying that because am a conceited donkey.
I'll put you opposite her at dinner.
Come and see, and be conquered.
But you don't know anything about it.
Oh, you are cold, Roger said, and I am keeping you.
That will set you up, little lady.
And she doesn't want to be smothered.
I do not think that I am a coward.
And the review was not a pleasant one.
I don't see half enough of you.
I ain't known you all your life for nothin.
I have shut myself up for many years.
The rest of us probably deserve what we get.
Faithfully and gratefully always, ROGER POOLE.
But I'm an old man, and she is such a child.
Until you teach her that I'm not--fit?
He is doing it for your good, Barry.
Doesn't Poole make a living down there?
Then why do you let him hang around you?
But, sweetheart, you'd be--poor.
It is because I've got to fight--devils.
So little and young to deal with a thing like this.
Oh, the little white face with the shining eyes!
Leila, you are making it hard for me.
I was thinking of my carroty head.
She looks like you, Delilah told him.
Except for her nose, she's a Ballard.
If you think you are going to fail, you'll fail.
I know you can, dear boy, she bent and kissed him.
You know I'm not going to let you.
You haven't anything to do with it.
Find me one, mother, and I'll marry him.
But you're trying to be all head, dear child.
Then I drew myself up in an attempt at haughtiness.
Now look at yourself, he commanded.
But some day she'll let me do them.
Did you ever tell her that you wanted to do it?
She always has a sense of possible release.
You are living once more, aren't you?
Porter won't care, just so he gets you.
I wonder why we are so foolish.
A man can always make out a case for himself.
You're such a quiet little mouse.
You must not put these ifs in their way.
Packed trains bring the people.
That's their way of expressing themselves.
After Roger went away, I saw her picture.
Oh, poor little widow, poor little child!
Because you have tried work--and it has failed.
You have tried independence--and it has failed.
You haven't even a pulpit to preach from.
Is that the way with all women?
All the people are crazy about her.
He dropped my arm and looked down at me.

And that's a splendid idea, Dolly.
Oh, I think I would have, Dolly.
I wouldn't mind seeing Lolla get off, Dolly.
I don't think she's as bad as the others.
She was treacherous and lied to you.
I don't think I want anyone to be punished, Dolly.
They stick to one another, don't they?
That's what's the matter with you, Dolly.
Over there, a man can't call his soul his own.
But you are going to be, remember that.
In Poland, it was just the same.
Why, there ain't nothin to be nervous about!
We think a sight of him down there.
He's a fine man, m'am; yes, indeed, a fine man!
I ain't never been to law myself.
CHAPTER V A TANGLED NET Arrested?
Why, Charlie, I never heard anything so absurd!
He puts me on the defensive, right away.
They were indicted, you know, for kidnapping.
Niles isn't handling the case right.
You won't do any more damage, I guess.
Here, I'll ease youse a bit so youse can talk.
John will go to jail for six months.
And I don't know that it's such a bad thing.
I never saw anything like these girls of yours.
You don't want to be last, do you?
I'll beat you next time, you two!
Then you'd know what a real scolding is like.
I used to, but I'm sort of sorry for her, Dolly.
Well, I hate her, just the same!
Don't be too confident yet, Dolly.
And they are the silliest things, sometimes!
Look back there where we came from!
That's the only thing that makes us safe.
Why don't you go to the land you're allowed to use?
We're going to stay here just as long as we like!
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Remember that we're in the right.
She can get angry, all right, Dolly, she said.
And do you see these screens that you can let down?
Once on the ground, her task was easy.
I don't think you mean to be wicked, any of you.
It isn't American
They can't be doing that for fun.
All they want to do is to bother us.
We want to make them see they're not wanted here.
I might have known you wouldn't do anything sneaky.
Whatever did you do to them, Dolly?
I never heard such a noise in my life!
All the girls will have to suffer for what you did.
They have a better right to be here than you have.
But then she doesn't know any better.

Hugh was attacked by the other.

Keep out of the line of fire, Hugh.
Are you a coward, too, sir, as well as a ruffian?
You think he was mad to insult me.
Did you think I was never coming?
Dear me, what impatient creatures boys are!
I doubt not that these Dutchmen mean us no harm.
I suppose that is that rascal Fulke, Rupert said.
They have as many lives as cats.
That's right, lads, that's right.
Let us bury this poor little child.

He is desperate, and, as you know, relentless.
But are you not stabbed, Master Rupert?
We will find her, he said, wherever she be.
Suddenly the real attack began.
It is all you deserve, Monsieur le Duc.
Oh, oh, mademoiselle, an English boy!
And now let me look at you, Monsieur Rupert.
You will come with papa, won't you?
You have already done more than harm enough.
Oh, monsieur, but you are sly, you and l'Anglaise.
Are you dressed as Monsieur d'Etamps lackey still?
And that is all you will say, prisoner?
You will never go out alive unless you do.
Or did you kiss Madame de Maintenon?
And now goodbye, and may fortune attend you.
These poor brutes have gone thirty already.
There is no hanging matter in that.
Perhaps mademoiselle will like to go below.
Eugene was wounded in the head.
Did you ever hear a crazy man laugh?
No, sir; I'm going to jump, and so are you.
That last impulse to destroy me has never left him.
Just watch your ropes and take it easy.
They say my face was black as a coal.
Touch one of these lines, and you touch his life.
I have ways enough of dying as it is, says he.
He'll tell you if that ain't right.
They said they weren't that kind of fools.
And he went up hanging by his foot?
Now, cut her quick, soon as I climb in.
Why don't you give up the life?
I'll introduce you to the boys.

Did he come over with a good lift?

It wouldn't take much to break his back.
You wouldn't get a man to do it blindfolded?
They get chloroform same as a person.
You know he lets me put my head in his mouth.
What ye lookin at, little boys?
Yes, went on Bostock, he's wild enough.
Oh, you'd better believe he came!
Poor fellow got in his cage by mistake.
He did that twice a day for over a year.
He couldn't turn coward if he tried.
Do you mean that a white spark wouldn't do it?
Say, you'd oughter seen the boys run!
She's willing and gentle, sir, and easy running.
Got to: you hit it up, and I'll skin her.
That is where he works, poor lad!

You are always up to some tricks.
You need gasoline, just as I did.
Never mind, spoke their mamma, I'll help you.
And this time I'll help you roast them, said Jacko.
No, I'm not going to eat you, said the bear.
And I'm not going to let you go.
I will prove it to you, said Jumpo.
Did you bring the pipes, Jimmie?
You get right out of here, you bad bear!
Are you really going to eat me?
You can't get away, and you can't eat me!
I am a chirping black cricket, was the answer.
No, indeed; we're two monkey boys, spoke Jacko.
What are you monkey boys doing here?
He'll be wanting to eat me next.
Is that going to be a tent, Jumpo?
Do you think your airship will sail, Jumpo?
I guess my mamma is calling me.
Oh, that's too bad, said Jumpo.
You just get it down and smell of it.

They don't like us--none of them do.
You are entering into alliance with outcasts.
I will not be released, he said.
They laugh at him, and so at all of us.
that is what you don't understand!
I cannot, therefore, hear them insulted.
You serve no purpose by keeping them.
Then--after that--I saw a lot of her.
You young fool, at last from Garrett.
You don't care for her any longer, Robin?
Don't think me such a rotter, he said.
I'm only twenty-six, and you're--oh!
He doesn't know, he doesn't understand!
Her hands were clenched and her face was white.
I am, therefore, quite ignorant as regards facts.
Isn't that a little rude, Mr. Trojan?
It will be the most regretted action of your life.
You do not know what people have done to us here.
There--and now, of course, you think me hateful.

If you are, you won't insist on seeing her.
I'd advise you to act accordingly.
_Nothing_, he barked out at me.
Didn't even look up till I let loose on him.
But you got out, persisted Ring, maliciously.
I won't hurt him any more than he needs.
Now don't stir till I'm in position.
It's all off--there's a girl here.
Was it really a band of Indians?
Only a bunch of cow-punchers on a bat.
They most always come on just after a heavy meal.
They're all a lot of cheap skates, anyway.
You mustn't forget I chased off them redskins.
I don't believe there are any Indians over here.
Suppose I'd a roped _her_ instead of the old man!
I see my finish when you go away.
There ain't any feed that interests me but you.
Oh, _you_ wouldn't complain, I know that.
Her tone hurt as she pointed at him.
Don't you dare come here another time.
I never heard of anything more--more awful.
That's about all you're good for now.
Your symptoms are about the worst ever.
The climate may freeze this poison out of you.
he asked, putting her on defense.
It's just as foolish as can be.
Girl, you've got to be good to me this time.
I wish he'd jack us all up a bit.
This is no place for you, she defiantly said.
You're getting deeper into the slough all the time.
So you better vamoose to-morrow.
I don't care what he has ordered!
I'll stay here, and so shall you!
Dad can't boss me, and I won't let him run you out.
Besides, I know she would make a terrible scene.
Don't you tell, she said to the Mexican.
Boys-- began Fan in appeal, but she got no further.
What right have I to despise these people?
The woman is false, the man is treacherous.
I only knew my wrongs--my despair--my hate.
The man you hated was my brother.
All the men in her world were rough.
it's none o my funeral, anyway.
You're nothing but a kid--a baby.
The man don't live that can scare him.
He's a damage to the community.
I'll have your heart for this, he said, venomously.
You're cinched any way you look at it.
He's just around the corner, waiting for you.
Run away, girl, said Kelley, softly.
I hate these people--I want to go with you.
Yells of vengeance rose: Lynch him!
My name's Kelley--Tall Ed the boys call me.
Would you consider taking me in as a side partner?
No, I want you to come with me to the train.
You'll be part of the scenery for them.
You've got the complexion of a barber.
He was from the South also, and spoke with a drawl.
I used to know him down on the Perco.
Does it all with his legs, I guess.
He's happier being called a partner.
Men aren't such brutes, after all.
Fred, what's the matter with you?
No. He has been working for--a saloon.
Pears like that is the best thing for you to do.
Mother must never know of this.
I'll write--but I ain't much of a fist at it.
Never returned to my own people.
I will go once more before I die.

I wonder if she remembers her performance?
Eugene, go back and wait for us.
See that Pogosa is comfortable.
The squaw will take care of herself.
Well, let's see what she's like.
I am going right up and bring her down.
You shall go back to your people.
Do you think there are any such men in here now?
I suspect it's too lonely even for a cattle-thief.
I like trails that make men quake.
Tell him to come inside--I'm not afraid of him.
Hanged if I do, especially now.
You are imperiling your life for nothing.
After I leave you it doesn't matter.
After that girl reported me, life didn't count.
There isn't a thing you can do, miss.
Are you tied up to the professor?
He can't be just right in his head.
That's mighty white of you, he responded, slowly.
He tapped his revolver as he spoke.
I hate to ask you--but it hurts me so.
Men were fine animals for the wild.
It's cold and goin to be colder.
If it's the sheriff stay in here with me.
Pears like I'm gettin old and foolish.
I'd rather die here in the hills.
No matter
If I fail you'll find me up there.
Why don't you stay and take your lawful punishment?
You will surely perish up there in the cold.
He will know you cannot escape.
You don't look none too slick yourself.
What _is_ the latest kink in rods?
Well, sir, I had him flat down.
Does that look like she was his daughter?
They've had time to hide em or burn em.
I will see that you are treated right.
Once I forced him to leave my premises, he said.
It is evident that they were vile.
I don't believe that girl was ever on the place.
They'd have dusted out last night.
The valley has always resented us.
I wish you'd let me come over and teach you.
It's only some smart Aleck's practical joke.
These people would hang me if they could.
I don't understand their hate of us.
Yes, yes, let us go, he said, bitterly.
We'd like you to have them--wouldn't we, daddy?
I had come to hate men and to despise women.
I won't have her humiliated in this way.
Your prisoners will be here when you come back.
Say, you want to watch out for Abe Kitsong.
Abe is sure to make you trouble.
I'm sorry, but that's my orders.
The Kitsongs'll get ye, if ye don't watch out.
Abe sure has got it in for you, Hans.
What right had you to arrest them kids?
I'm going to have you jugged for false arrest.
He jumped me, complained Kitsong.
_Vamose_, every man of you, or I'll run you all in.
I'll get you yet, called Kitsong, venomously.
You did right in bringing her down.
You're wasting time and so is Abe.
I'd like to work the third degree on her.
I hate to have you let this gang drive you out.
She's done more than that, Jack.
I'm as ambitious as a ward politician!
Then I decided to bring her down, too.
They belong to that Kauffman girl.
You become ridiculous when you do.
I'll have you removed if you utter another word.
Raines then called out: She's playing off.
Do you know what we can do to you?
In that case, he said, I'll take you into camp.
Let him put the girl on the train, he said.
Oh no. Let them go
They had a fight and Abe was hurt.
He needn't complain, if she don't.
I have no fight with any one else.

COTTON'S FASTI ECCLESIAE HIBERNIAE.
BIBLIOTHECA TOPOGRAPHICA BRITANNICA.
OLIVER'S MONASTICON DIOECESIS EXONIENSIS.
I was the lean dog that lieth in wait for offal.
All he could think was, O accursed old woman!
So he said, Tis a pact between us, O old woman!
Renounce not either, whatsoever ensueth.
Be not abashed, O my bridegroom to be!
Wonderful is the audacity of impudence!
thy love is wanting at the proof.
But I will not have her, O my son!
Ye twin palm-trees, male and female!
broad is the back of your servant.
for Boolp is an old man, even very old.
I'll leave thee not in this life.
So he called to the guard, Shackle him!
the logic of the lash shall be tried upon thee.
Sleep with the left eye, Keep the right awake.
Tis then a combat twixt him and me.
And the Serpent replied: Ruby lip!
see what she reserveth for you.
Oh, Boolp, a pretty dissimulation!
Tis to subdue them I go; yea, to crush them.
Then he, The oath of Ruark is no rope of sand!
and wherefore these evil names of me?
Thrice this day shall pay your due.
Tis even so
Quoth Khipil, To hear is to obey.
Oh, when I die, then bury me in their bowers!
Then Shahpesh laughed, and cried, Chafe not!
it is an ill thing and a hideous!
I'll delay no longer, I, Shibli Bagarag.
And she cried reproachfully, O fool!
Pluck it by the root with thy right hand!
I whispered in his hairy pointed red ear, Sleep!
here is she, here am I, yonder my dominions!
a terrible one
So fetter I the strong with my allurements!
and I blunt the barb of high intents!
do ye not mock me, O masters of Aklis!
I the King am warned by base creatures.
tis I that am match for a white ball!
And is it in the pursuit of further thwackings?
to greatness by the aid of thwackings!
But Abarak cried, O Karavejis and Veejravoosh!
and they said the same to Shibli Bagarag.
is the name of my beloved hateful to thee?
Then she called to Koorookh, Seize him!
and for thee to command is for me to obey!
Do this, and thy part's done, O Kadza!
and I, a poor drooping tendril, left to wither?
Thereat, Luloo wept afresh, and cried, Ah, cruel!
and he's witched there for an ill purpose.
flea of iniquity and abomination!
am I doomed to thy torments?--so let's spread!
as the poet says,--O accursed flea!
by Allah, he's awful in his mightiness!
He dismissed her with a purse the next day.
Ripton was a capital boy
He could not prove he was not a fool!
You looks an old poacher, you do.
Giles Blaize never stands nonsense!
The boys tried to close with him.
No curtain-lecturin with a pipe.
Penny a day, and there y'are, primed!
Casion calls me t'other day to Newcastle!--Eh?
Varmer Bollop, t'other day, has's rick burnt down.
God warn't above the devil then, I thinks.
Drink the Fire-worshippers, if you will.
Why, what did you say about Blaizes, Rippy?
So would I. And he shall suffer for it.
Is it old Blaize has been putting you up!
Richard answered him: Yes
Rady's safe, and uncle never blabs.
I ain't that sort of chap, Ricky, I can tell you.
You don't mean this Rip, do you?
Is it transportation for rick-burning?
Why, you haven't an atom of courage.
Why, you let it out every second of the day.
Are you afraid?--And then you contradict yourself.
And keep out of Adrian's way as much as you can.
He's a mortal wild young gentleman!
May I never be where there are no boys!
Think of the shifts they are put to all day long!
An age of rampant little minds, my dear Austin!
But now, pray, consult with me about these boys.
Remember his good points now he's gone, Ricky.
I never met a coward myself, Austin continued.
A coward hardly objects to drag in his accomplice.
Ask a favour of that big brute, Austin?
Surely you've punished him enough, boy?
He turned you off, and you fired his rick.
She's a lady, as good as the best of em.
I don't like you none the worse for't.
Farmer Blaize was positive twas a lie.
Above board with me, and you'll find me handsome.
Speak out, and don't be thinkin.
What business ha you to be a-thinkin?
Liars, perj'rers, bribers, and c'rrupters!--Stop!
You've done for yerself already!
You've been a-tampering with my witness.
My witness there has been bribed.
You're a boy and'll learn better.
Now you must stand yer luck, all o ye.
I'm not cruel, but I hate lies.
I-I lied to him--the Liar must eat his Lie.
I was polite of course but I would not look at her.
And he was deaf, as well as blind.
Let it be known that I only require discreetness.
Do you think no girls innocent?
But they are more innocent than boys, I am sure.
Because of their education, madam.
Either we are very mighty or you are very weak.
But whatever we are, and if we are bad, bad!
I can sit at your feet every day unquestioned.
You would have made an admirable mother, madam.
He thinks more at his age of old women like me.
to kiss a woman's hand, and die!
And you really do not feel that you are wet?
Hail the occasion propitious, O British young!
you will henceforward sit alone.
While he has yet some innocence, nauseate him!
Facts were at the bottom of what he said.
The apathy of Englishmen will become proverbial.
And look you: take it on medical grounds.
pipe on to these dear innocents!
Pipe no more, Love, for a time!
Are you looking for your young gentleman?
It ain't to fire no more ricks.
Don't hit too hard, sir, Tom suggested.
The Huron is stark mad about her.
I think that God made you, and has given you to me.
He lifts her hand, and presses his mouth to it.
I love the nuns for having taught you.
It will be put a stop to tomorrow, sir.
He has had the impudence to steal a march on me!
If you see Benson mind you tell him.
Master Ricky is a peppery young man.
What a noise that old ruffian makes!
She would smile on if both were being birched.
Mr. Hadrian, sir, he's a devil!
The coward bobbed while I struck said Richard.
He's a devil, sir, I do believe, sir.
he's a devil!--I can't move, Mr. Hadrian.
For women are not the end, but the means, of life.
Benson is now a piece of history.
Richard is the god of her idolatry.
When you see her, I am sure you will.
Nom'tive Mouser!--'nough to make ye mad, sir!
Clean gone, that she were, sir.
Cryin all night and all day, I sh'd say.
packed off!--Can't have her here now.
You may guess I wants her bad enough.
You sent her away to protect her from me, then?
It appears your education's peculiar!
What's more I won't have nothin of it.
So now, sir, you do the same, and I'll thank ye.
Depend upon it I'm not your enemy, Mr. Fev'rel.
Look to her, Tom, and then come to me in my room.
Pure women have a second youth.
A young philosopher's an old fool!
Strength is a God to you--Purity a toy.
Men are seedlings: Women--slips!
Berries I fancy your Pegasus has a taste for.
I don't think you gave her any legs.
Why, what are you laughing at, uncle?
You know, I intend to make you well.
What the deuce do you want with doctor, boy?
Take care of your stomachs, boys!
She finds him with her wig on in company!
I didn't begin on the old lady.
I just see what you're fit for.
I think I said shameful things.
Did you ever hear such nonsense?
Punish Helen, very young, lightly.
And first he claimed her mouth.
Call me that name, he repeated.
Did you see the change come over her?
Sombre grew the street they had last night aroused.
You're the best old soul in the world!
It's no use your trying to swallow it, Rip!
So as you was born, so shall ye be!
He was a black Berry to me, my dear!
Kissing don't last: cookery do!
Their memories scarce seem their own!
But, mama, the other expostulated, it's so nasty.
You have grown from a boy to a man.
We are staying with the Foreys close by here.
Don't be bashful with young women, mind!
Now I've got you, I mean to keep you.
Of course you were indifferent!
He isn't a boy, or a man, but an engine.
only he does such absurd things!
Have patience, O impetuous young man!
Then shall few men match your sublime fury.
Will you not crouch and be cowards?
said Richard, just wetting his mouth.
good-bye, and Heaven bless ye both!
O you wanton, improvident creature!
I been and married the bread out of my own mouth.
Did you make it yourself, ma'am?
He would bring her to the furnace.
Won't you see it all, kind sir?
You were all reasonable and proper, ma'am.
was Adrian's comment in the street.
I'll have none of it, I tell you!
What fool has been doing this, then?
Yes, your nephew: my cousin: Richard!
I've no doubt we could hang him.
Yes, and the Greeks and the Trojans can fight.
Till he knew what women are made of, sir!
The wretched boy has ruined himself!
Is it that abominable country person, Adrian?
The men smiled and looked vacuous.
I desire you to take me to that woman immediately.
And so he sat nursing the devil.
Ah, wretched Scientific Humanist!
And you like them hard, Mr. Harley?
On the contrary, I like them soft.
I'll have one like her some day.
I'll put you on board in my boat.
She agreed to simulate as Adrian had suggested.
A man must deserve to live, as you say.
Not when you're racing the Begum, I think.
You have the characteristics of one.
Arguing with Adrian was an absurd idea.
And they all will, if she isn't a coward.
You can't drag her like a captive, you know?
You, you, Lady Judith, you wouldn't be a coward?
Women are born cowards, you know.
Best leave them to their own freaks.
She knows whether she cares a fig for a fellow.
And they expect me to stand by and see it done!
Come, come, my good Ricky; not all!
A married man, you know, said Adrian.
He is trying you, child, and you must be patient.
In fact, they are, and must be, aliens.
And this you will drive him to.
but alas, that is the least of the evils.
I don't think her hair was black.
Indeed, I am very wretched, sir.
He will marry that woman, Adrian.
Now that's too much to ask of a quiet man.
Richmond's within the rules of your prison.
You're in for another rick, you two, said Adrian.
It's another of his villanies, I know.
I want to make you be just to women.
The Serpent has slimed her so to secure him!
Why it'd be as bad as my Berry!
And men don't do that, she whimpered.
helping blindfold an old woman!
you never been dudgeonin already?
you haven't been peckin at one another yet?
His temptations was strong, and his flesh was weak.
That's not matrimony, it's divorcin!
Then I say checked matrimony is as bad.
Well, I'm waiting his pleasure.
And why don't she come up to you?
He's going to bring me an unfort'nate female!
if that woman stay here, I go forth.
She trembled, breathing low: My God, forgive, me!
When he kissed her, her skin was cold.
Habit had legalized his union with her.
He had burnt a rick and got married!
She told him what she liked in him.
And the world treats her shamefully.
Have you forgotten you have a wife, Richard?
There's my aunt: Remember you have a wife!
I suppose I had an idea you were a woman.
D'you think if the world whips me I'll wince?
D'you think I care for what they say or do?
At a certain age they can't be quite natural.
It wears off when they're women.
No, she caressed his hand, and there is none.
I am not so bad as I'm painted!
Do you expect me to bury myself alive?
Oh, the glorious wreck she looked.
We must all die--the good and the bad.
But you're not vain, and that's a protection.
You just look it, you blooming boy.
And immolated himself intentionally?
A white visage reappeared behind a spring of flame.
If I haunt you, you can't forget me, Richard.
He a hero
You will not leave me yet, Richard?
His Highness below likes lovely women, I hear say.
You don't know all my accomplishments yet, Richard.
He knew her what she was, this lady.
I haven't advanced an inch, he groaned.
Isn't it enough to make a fellow mad?
I rather like to hear a woman swear.
She must see the trahison with her eyes.
Dear little girl!--she's only a child.
But you say you have met such--such very bad women.
Your misfortune, Lord Mountfalcon?
He would have been such a hero, but for that.
To be goin and kissin a strange hairy man!
He's a notorious living rake, that Lord Montfalcon.
He won't meneuvele Bessy Berry with his arts.
I'm dyin for a cup o tea, my dear.
Now I say this angel-infant come from on high.
The bliss of the chaste was hers.
Lucy arranged for Mrs. Berry to sleep with her.
If she is with you his way will be clear.
Women, rapid by nature, have no idea of science.
You will bring your wife to me when you return.
Ask me what I think of her, sir!
I must beg you not to intrude further, ma'am.
Richard despises me, was the next entry.
I wished to die while his mouth was on mine.
Richard said he would die rather than endure it.
He is not a coward, nor am I. He hates cowards.
Clari, and Don Ricardo, and his laugh.
If I find it I shall come to claim her.
Do you want to try my nerves, my dear fellow?
Feeling, that's the slayer, coz.
You're not much changed, Adrian.
Go, batten on the baby, cannibal.
The next minute he found himself escaladed.
My relationship is not so defined as yours, sir.
You nurse him yourself, of course?
You're very feverish, dear Berry.
I will undress you, and see to you, dear heart!
I feel it all on my side already.
He may be wanting to come to you now.
It soothed him to be near a woman.
Why can't you go to your wife, Richard?
It's your second bridals, ye sweet livin widow!
Going to that unpleasant place together.
I made love to the man to get it out of him.
Say it's because you don't like his face.
Don't bother me with questions.
They men have come to their senses.
Now that he did they mocked him.
true, good, glorious, as the angels of heaven!
I was the coward--I the wretched vain fool!
Or you take blessed baby, and I'll go.
I do not imagine he will abuse women any more.
She died five days after she had been removed.
I have taken him upstairs to look at her.
THE EXPEDITION BY MOONLIGHT III.
THE EXPLOSION AT BROOKFIELD LV.
CONTAINS A FURTHER ANATOMY OF WILFRID LVIII.
Arabella was punished for claiming rights of birth.
I call this quite shameful of you!
You are cruel, he heard her say.
And you like ze clap of ze hands.
You are going to sing to z moon through z nose.
What absurd creatures women are!
I see you are all bent on spoiling her.
Are you discontented with the tone, child?
Would you not rather let me take you?
I have your permission to smoke?
That he has never forgiven the English for!
It has made me and my mother miserable ever since.
I cried with rage, and he called to me, Sandra!
She put her lips to his fingers.
He used to crush my dreams afterwards!
Jews, she obeyed the dictate, out of my mind.
At all events, it won't hurt you.
Woman is especially subject to it.
On the contrary, permit me to say that you are.
Let me add, individually as much poorer.
Read their stereotyped descriptions.
And not so bad, not so bad, I call it!
didn't you know you were done, sir?
Yes, but, Mr. Pole fumed, I don't.
You pledge your word to a piece of folly.
This is foolish: it, therefore, cannot be.
You are not mad about the Italians?
An artistic people cannot hate long.
Do me the favour to look at me.
You are all kind to girls, to women, to anything!
Foreigners pertinaciously misunderstand us.
He may look like Macduff, but he is a lamb.
Hillford don't hear stuff like that, do em?
Girls can only say, I will perish with him.
Wilfrid whispered: men kiss us when we are happy.
Wicked, filthy little creature that I was!
Put your head into the sack, and think!
He explained: You're girls, you know.
Bella, that woman has seen papa.
We shall live like hermits worried by a demon.
Dear, simple, innocent old man!
To act a farce for their benefit!
don't talk of ut; I'll be thinkin', of my coffin.
I'll be as sick as a cat, I will.
But, I'll come, if it's the rroon of my stomach.
He has insisted, and you must submit.
Could you bear the reflex of the woman?
This woman, I repeat, is rich, and we want money.
won't he know what it is to be a widde!
God grant they may never want!--eh?
Is that too much, papa, darling?
Why do you talk Irish in the dark?
And my purse left behind, like the skin of a thing.
and I will speak, and ye shann't interrupt me!
why, you never have money; you waste it if you do.
Your memory's worth more than that!
to the deuce with your ma'am
which anything...I beg your pardon, Slang!
Polite society rightly excludes it, because...
She did not lay herself out to attract.
But, until she comes, no man is known.
and he bent her knuckles fondlingly.
He ordered her out of the room.
What do you know of, to make me ill?
And now that you are here, you drive him away.
But you must submit to be kissed, my darling.
If I do not, you will despise me.
You are burnt like a bean--hein?
Now, take my dvice, little Belloni, and don't go.
And so you are, what you say, in lofe.
A husband, if it is your taste.
Zen, I say, you shall, you shall lofe a man.
For, a writ once served, you are a prisoner.
Could anything be more preposterous?
And Mr. Chips deserves to lose his money!
I am nothing to Italy any more.
Why do you make her so hideous?
Confound historical facts that make her cry!
he breathed imperiously in her ear.
We shall not burst out about zis Riga man.
I'd have every villain hanged, cried Mr. Pole.
We pay for him a sossand pound a monz.
Greek, and Russian, and Yankee, all zey beat you.
I am a Greek--I take an Englishman.
Get a husband and then you won't got to Italy.
Dozens of girls would, that I know.
You fancy me ill, don't you, my dear?
and the business torn like a piece of old rag!
I wonder what makes me so stiff.
Can't do business with a petticoat in the room.
He's called a rascal now, poor devil!
None of you do what your dads did.
You may get too high, eh?--Gallery?
No wonder these young sparks cut us all out.
wat you have de shame, you have de pluck, ah!
For God's sake, don't bother me!
Going and playing with an unprotected girl.
Is he a contemptible scoundrel?
I could bring him from any woman's side.
He'll be a beggar, if he don't.
The rascal's been at it for the last month.
You would have stopped my life, and Wilfrid's.
You've played the devil with mine.
If you go on like this, you've done for me!
CAN YOU PUT AWAY ALL PROPS OF SELF?
I don't commonly beat the bush long myself.
And he plays the tyrant, does he?
Love the poor devil--manage the rich, you mean.
Be as deaf as you like, you shall hear.
You're waiting for that, you unmanly dog!
Now you can't go on pretending sleep.
I know what that means, with you.
An Englishman might mean right--but you!
You think you've been dealing with a fool!
Not a bid of corage!--which is bad.
No, not once; and we are angry with her.
No
She saw the God:--you never will!
Nothin but his legs, my lady, she whispered.
Why, says I, doctor, ye think ut's maguc!
and all for a shrug
Don't let that girl come near me!
I--I can't get on with foreign girls!
Wilfrid, have you gone to that girl?
Now I have got it in my throat.
He will bring on a fit if you don't stop.
It is unfair to her
A man must not play with a girl.
I'll be cryin like a squeezed orr'nge presently.
A rosy rosy fresh bit of a mouth she's got!
I'm an awful coward, that's the truth.
my weak time's after my Porrt, my dears.
What are ye doin but sugarin the same dose, miss!
D'ye think my stomach's a fool?
Ye've hurrt me, and I'll say good-bye.
But they are the masters, not we!
They have a meeting every other night.
Does she have to kiss a sword and a book?
There was a perfect dagger in her eyes.
She is very little so, believe me!
And it's Pole that's turned--Pole!
I'm in bed, and you're a cold bath.
So the men look like fools, ye sly laughin fella!
The ffection I bear to your onnly remaining parent.
Ye won't call me a name, will ye?
I'd say, if ye weren't a borrn lady.
You I'll be more so than you were a month ago.
You see that I am just the same to you.
and opening them, all her face being red, Say it!
Her going there was not a freak
Or put penknives out of her way.
Make me a martyr to the sorrows of Italy once more.
If your eyes are bandaged now...
He's got nothin to do but swallow knolludge then.
Can you possibly tell what such a child can be?
This made the world look black to her.
And--and I cannot wait and feel like a beggar.
I intend to make him take the Madre with me.
You are wiz old Belloni, he called out.
Ze letter have been spied into by ze Austrians.
when it wants a physique of a saint!
Sandra Belloni, he added, gravely, lift up ze head!
Purcell!--I say she play ze fool, and look at her!
No: she refuse, and she is ruined.
What, I say, what zat dam silly smile mean?
The streets make me wish to die.
He is not ze friend of a couac-couac.
Will you touch me when I tell you not to?
And such a forr'ner as he is, to be sure!
Indeed, ma'am, you are welcome to him.
Ain't I the first to remember ut, Pole?
continued the aggravating woman.
my darlin garls, don't think ut my fault.
And Pole settin down his rroon to me!
It's like no candle in the darrk.
I see her now under a black shroud.
Or does she stare carelessly away?
You deserve well of your generation.
A little more experience, and she will have malice.
She wants nothing but that to make her consummate.
I swore to die this night it I did not see you!
And from you, Merthyr, to a girl such as she is!
Me she satisfies less and less.
The Piedmontese are mad for the signal.
The Austrian thinks he wastes us by slaughter.
Am I talking like a foreigner, Sandra mia?
Emilia throbbed, while they are fighting!
Let me see him, for he cannot resist me.
See him; see him, if you must, he said.
But now at least you have thrown off the mask.
And he is, besides, engaged-- Let her suffer!
I think I look on Winter when I see her lips.
Emilia shut her eyes, waiting for more.
And he saw me when I was that wretched heap?
let me be alone this evening in my bedroom.
Why do I always feel such a tyrant with you?
She can't learn: she can do nothing.
I complain that you never succeed.
She believed he was an Austrian spy.
She supposed him to be an Austrian spy!
be silent, and let that night die.
Women are devils of cleverness sometimes.
That woman is changeing you--doing all this.
Let me call you my own darling!
And you leave me to that woman.
She loves the Austrians, as you know.
I will not have it moved or touched till you-- Ah!
Let me have two seconds with her!
Ze man will find Pole is ruined.
if ye don't sound like wheedlin to keep me blind.
And you look none of the freshest.
The old man then sought to obliterate her utterly.
He will not understand my position!
She is; and yet she ain't, if you understand me.
What I feel about her is--hang it!
I am going down there, he said.
He would easily become an Austrian.
Emilia could have retorted, Cruel that you are!
If I must not come, tell them I kiss them.
He cried, poor unhappy man, real tears!
Nothing would stop him from humiliating himself!
She's a Goddess to me from this moment.
We will now sheath our battledores.
If he is, he deserves what he's got.
Perhaps not--for they ve got none.
SUGGESTS THE MIGHT OF THE MONEY DEMON IV.
ROBERT INTERVENES X. DAHLIA IS NOT VISIBLE XI.
She's like a coal nigh a candle.
It ain't respectful t age, I say.
Do wait, mother; all in good time.
out comes the keys: lockup everything
What's roused ye, you tiger girl?
Not much of a manager, brother Tony.
She's got a temper of her own too.
She must leave London, if she don't alter.
And what I said to your poor mother's true.
That's nettles to your uncle, my dear.
You make sure of her, do you, sir?
Then, none of us must care for him, uncle.
She's changed, but it's all for the better.
Oh, you pretty innocent in your sleep!
I wish your fists wouldn't stick to me so.
Gad, I don't get puffy half so soon as you.
She's got more life, more change in her, more fire.
What train did you come up by last night?
Edward kept his penetrative eyes on Algernon.
You understand what that means.
I don't think you'd know it, if she did.
It would excuse you for hating me.
I'm so wretchedly fastidious, don't you see?
Just as he did with her sister.
There isn't a particle of nonsense in her.
You are only a boy in their hands, my cousin Algy!
This story of yours cannot be true.
I am ceasing to have a complexion.
Oh, my dear, cold, loving, innocent sister!
and What a millioner fellow that is!
but they that knows him--hats off, I can tell you.
Once I was an idle young scaramouch.
This here's the girl for my money.
That girl will see you, if you don't take care.
Come, drink with me, my dearest.
He laughed scornfully: The little beggars!
and come through that crush, sir?
Dahlia, in God's name give me your help!
You m not going to push me out?
There's a Bible in your bedroom.
My first girl's gone to harlotry in London.
I ask you to take me for your husband.
I'm what you reckon a good young man.
Offence or no offence, I speak and you listen.
I didn't play spy on your acts, but your looks.
She's so beautiful, she can't do wrong.
Now you know me, that's enough.
If Dahlia's to be found, I'll find her.
What a rough fellow I must seem to you!
I can't bear it now I've seen you look soft.
A brute's a lucky dog, then, for I've got you!
It's a miserable thing, Robert.
Why don't you struggle, my girl?
I'm not a gentleman, I suppose!
So, if I could make you a lady--eh?
You are responsible, he swears.
Don't come to me about the fellow.
I'm not abusing you, Mr. Blancove.
Only it makes me feel thirsty, that's all.
you'll be Oriental when you present it.
It means, You're the prettiest widow in the world.
She's done me up for every other woman living.
If I can't have her, I'd rather you would.
He made love to Adeline Gosling.
It isn't ill-luck
And you're come back to keep em up, eh, Bob?
I drank afterwards, Robert replied.
Then the devil take you for a fool!
women make you feel it, by some way that they have.
Women brought the devil into the world first.
And he may have had harm done to him.
If they cap, get away, they win the day.
Says he--but he's mad, stark mad!
What else could he do, the fool?
Says he, That's a poor way of trying to stop me.
You're a bag of blue devils, oh dear!
Robert, moaned the petrified woman strike you?
Shut your fist and do it--quick.
You'll stand behind the door to do what I tell you.
Don't tell me they didn't fall upon you last night.
Nothing inside of me will, mother.
Mother, just listen: she's dark as a gipsy.
She has black hair, large brown eyes; see her once!
Lock the door
Well, never mind whether she's handsome or not.
What can I do but drink and forget?
You know he cannot possibly fight you.
That makes your behaviour to him worse!
I don't accuse you of madness, but, good heavens!
Gentlemen always give fair play before a woman.
Thank God, I've only been a fool for five minutes!
Hang me if I can stand his impudence!
I know what her idea of young fellows is.
Annoyance be hanged, my good Ned!
Pon my soul, I pity the fox I run down here.
Men with their vanity wounded may discover wonders!
You must learn that you are no longer a child.
Be an obedient girl and please me.
The woman seeking for an anomaly wants a master.
In reply, she called him Great Britain.
See what a mess you drag a man into, he said.
Oh, confound this infernal fellow!
I know your mind as well as my own.
You feel called upon to punish him.
You've seen her--all that's gone.
Don't argue it with me any more.
Leave real rascals to the Lord above, mother.
They're the mischief, old lady.
It's a good thing for men like you.
The question, Are you ashamed of yourself, then?
By the way, Mr. Blancove denies everything.
The door opened and closed on this man.
contracted, coffined, contemptible!
You precious swindler in petticoats!
Gals o your sort think I say, come!
I say, Dahly, he ain't a gentleman?
Gentlemen ain't caught so easy.
Your husband wouldn't let you come to us there--eh?
You rule him with a rod of iron.
Is it manly to follow me with studied insult?
I can bear the hatred of fools.
I can do nothing but write nonsense.
Tell me what you think of her behaviour.
Don't over-tax thy stomach, O youth!
Then go fast, my man, and you will soon see plenty.
Never mind bout that ther pound.
That's the truth, Mr. Blancove.
And if she could do that, pity was wasted on her!
They're weak, poor sort o things.
Perhaps you don't know what sort of a arm I've got?
Just you feel that ther muscle.
You've what they Londoners calls bonneted yourself.
Taint fair play, he said to Sedgett.
You leave that gentleman alone, you, sir?
I'll bet you she will, if you like.
And this is a common countryman.
You know my name, and what I am.
Marriage is an awful thing, where there's no love.
I'll wallop you at that game, said Sedgett.
Now, what's your business, confound you!
I asks for my own: no more n my own, it ain't.
You don't want me to change this, do you?
You dare to threaten to expose me to my relatives?
Why, my mother dealt with Samuels.
I must do it, while I'm a--a bachelor boy.
Here's the truth: she thinks I'm off with her.
I'll let em know all about you.
You'll never do anything with him, he said.
Algy, I said before, s a bad fish.
Hang me, if I think he'd have behaved like Ned.
One of them has made a fool of a girl.
He's got the same political opinions as you.
Turns you round his little finger!
That is why you misjudge women.
I hate them, she said, and her face expressed it.
You will be ruined, if you do not.
Percy, you question me like a husband.
Because you find you have not the courage?
If you remain as you are, think of the snares.
If you marry one you despise, look at the pit.
Robert marked him, and the blush as well.
Cause I don't take ne'er a notice.
Then you'll be kicked out, old man.
You are your own master, Edward.
Brutal selfishness is the phrase for my conduct.
Your girls of society are tasteless to me.
And they don't makes wives to working barristers.
Your husband will lead you there.
Yes; you are to obey, and do what I tell you.
I am not a child, and I say what I mean.
I can't explain it, and I don't excuse myself.
I know I have deeply offended and hurt you.
She will soon be out of your reach.
This is a moment to use your reason.
Why, what monstrous delusion is this?
He studied the art of pleasing women.
She is here, he said, menacingly.
Do you know where that man lives?
And I'm the dog that gets the bad name.
This marriage can never take place!
Are they mad with some absurd country pride?
That foul dog?--Or you, stay where you are.
We're all as slow as Mas Gammon, I reckon.
We speak truth, nothing but truth.
Set me adrift, and I drink hard.
If she goes away with him she'll know it.
He will come for her, and claim her.
You drag me out of deep ditches.
To see her taken away by such a man!
Not when he has flung her off, Robert?
He's not the worst sinner, scoundrel as he is.
You're comfortable and dark here, my dear.
No wickeder than other places, I'll be bound.
Never loved e'er a young woman in my life.
I come to you, because I know you are rich.
It will be a curse to you, uncle.
Why, uncle, will you let me be ashamed of you?
I pray to heaven, and I meet you, and you have it.
And you say you are not rich, uncle?
You are awfully white, dear uncle.
It's a tremendous comfort--shuts mouths.
Sinners are not to repent only in words, uncle.
Her widened eyes intoxicated him.
I play the fool wi ne'er a sheep alive, Mr. Robert.
Had a fight with s bolster, and got th wust of it.
No, dearest; he will not trouble you.
See; I kiss the Book, and swear to you, my beloved!
Written--Oh, base man that he is!
and there is none to claim me but he.
If I saw up there the warning, You shall not!
My skin is like a toad's to him.
I say, Permit no worse, or take the consequences.
I am chained, and I have no repentance in me.
If I am dragged away, I'm afraid I shall curse him.
They're most subject to trances, my sweet.
The coldness of you young women!
And looking so, as she says it.
Brother Tony, don't you see her?
Why, I never saw such a sight as you.
Dahlia took her softly by the neck, and kissed her.
And there's an end of my likings and my misconduct.
(I am simply submissive.) Why not my name?
Where's your banker's book, brother Tony?
And every post I see s a policeman.
You've robbed me, and you shall drink!
Do you people here think me a fool?
You've been trying to undermine me.
He would sell me to save the farm.
After that he can't, can't claim her.
Your husband has come for you, and you go with him.
Know that, and let me hear no threats.
I'll behave well to her, I swear.
You know the kind of girl your friend fancies.
The poor boy would go to his doom.
Count me a miserably heartless woman.
THE DAUGHTERS OR THE SHEARS IV.
CONTAINS A WARNING TO ALL CONSPIRATORS XLV.
he says, I won't swallow the doctor!
I never touched him, he says, and I never will.
Then he's a gentleman, and can do as he likes.
Couchant means squatting, you know.
At least she might have had the decency!
I decidedly would refuse to see her, aunt!
and prating of their relationship everywhere.
You are like so many intrusive oxen--absolutely!
If you knew what I have to endure!
such polish as you know not of in England.
and he is all that a woman could desire.
And what do you think I had the audacity to do?
I am a Harrington as much as any of us!
what hypocrites we all are, mio Deus!
That divine portal was matrimony.
Now there's where you're too English.
I hate being such a hypocrite, madam.
and you would have said you were that!
covered with glory!--a hero, Van!
Allow none: gently, but firmly.
Evan would walk--he would die rather.
Are you impatient with this young man?
By the way, I've satisfied these men.
Now, Dandy, sit on the edge of the bed.
and quietly sat through his caresses.
But what would you have me do, mother?
No great harm done when you're silent.
You're the puppet of your women!
Are you not a Radical at heart?
You can make a greater fool of yourself, then?
I say he shall live like a gentleman!
I say he shall squat like a Turk!
What an old rogue you are, Tom!
And that she loves him I have proof positive.
You blush
A Harrington is anything but a coward.
You, with all the pains I have lavished on you!
You shall not stop here another day!
Polly Fence, he used to say, sweet Polly Fence!
I must make you angry before her, I see that!
He do snore that loud-Gearge do!
Raikes was for condescending to accept.
I say, not fust time, not by many a time, taint.
I like men not to forget a custom.
Don't be a hypocrite, and say you don't--you do.
Confess openly and be absolved.
Admetus flocks I guard, yet am a God!
Even this creature would despise us!
Albeit they are Britons, it abashes them.
Be you a Muster Eav'n Harrington, Esquire?
Or must I have and old woman, aunt?
Come, come, none o that, sir--ha!
here I bes on top of a gentleman!
Isn't this just like you, my dear Evan?
Then, of course, she torments them.
My brother and myself are scarcely English.
Will you instruct me in your creecket?
But a man is what he is, and must stand upon that.
His contempt for our weak intellects is ineffable.
Evan alone can look between the eyelids of a woman.
If she comes I do not fear her.
And that reminds me of the Madre.
He is insufferable and next to useless.
Beautiful women always welcome.
Carry will be invited with your little man ....
Am I personally offensive to them, Mr. Harry?
Lost my luck with the old lady long ago.
Don't be uppish about it--will you?
I'm ready to die with laughing.
Have you seen her before, Jack?
I was resigned till I heard my friend to-lool!
I plied my rustic friends every night.
Dang un, he do maak a chap laugh!
Oh, Mr. Harrington; oh, ain't I punished!
And what have you been doing to be punished?
Well, did he bring you here and leave you?
The others may go and drown themselves.
Perhaps my arms are pressing you?
You can teach her to pretend not to, if you like.
We must be silent before our prudish sister.
I went straight to Lady Racial, my dear.
It was foolish of her to offend me.
Will you imagine Carry is for not accepting it!
Carry has only to look as she always does.
One sees Strike sitting on her.
Once more, may Heaven bless you all!
Countess de Lazy-Lazy, I think.
Why, Ferdinand, he can beat you in anything!
Mr. George was black-eyed and obese.
We're all fools one time in our lives!
that efflorescence of sublime imposture!
And in a whisper, You look superb.
Are you not touched, dearest Carry?
For God's sake, think of your face!
Disguise is imperative for you.
You with your hair in my style are equally safe.
So the oldest Tory in the county is a fox?
I stretch out my hand to the pauvre diable.
was stronger in that department.
Enamoured young men have these notions.
What my punishment would have been!
I must tell you, to defend myself.
Now, I give you fair warning, you know.
I m hanged if I can make it out.
With young people one knows what that means.
Then you must be blind, my dear.
You'll have to obey me, my boy.
Do you want me to prostrate on all fours, Rose?
Of all men, you to be on your knees!
I must punish you, Rose apostrophized her.
She can hurt us really, if she pleases.
Study his whims, and you'll never want.
And whether his sheets are aired.
Thing's done fit to toss on a dungheap, aha!
Why, he'll snap your head off for a word.
Mrs. Mel joined in: Or a ------ Don't!
Knead down in the middle of the bed.
Where's your Dandy this morning, ma'am?
We are too much for the donkey, she said.
Are you going to cry about him?
I think you are really trembling.
And don't they call these creatures sn-snips?
Election be ------ hem!--beg pardon, my lady.
I think it bad to check an oath or a sneeze.
Is this gross collusion, Mr. Tom?
She must be a good gal, my lady.
Are you going to lock her up, my lady?
No. Nor shall I whip her with rods.
Not aware I've ever done you any harm, my lady.
A vile adventuress, as I firmly believe.
What does she do all day with your mother?
Girls may be shut up, as you propose.
Harrington has the knack with you women.
You need not lie any more to please me.
Do you want to make her humble and crouch to you?
No keeping anything from you, ever!
Ferdinand, pray disperse yourself.
Jealousy, I suppose, for you're very agreeable.
And, do you know, your Mama is coming to-day?
You do not look well, sweet child.
Would you dare to do it to a strange lady?
You do not credit such atrocity?
I was in the most ferocious rage!
I watched every chance of his being exposed.
Go, and leave me, pray, she said.
Mama!--of course you did not accuse him--but, Mama!
I really think she is worse than Papa.
I mean, fellows with anything in them are.
My dear Harrington, when you hit you knock down.
Whatever you may want send to me for.
Remember that is what you must do.
And as for grammar, I'd soon teach her that.
Would you throw yourself away on her?
You will not repent it, was answered.
he said, impatiently; spare your ridicule.
and you suffer their plots to drive you forth.
Call on your Creator, and be my judge, if you dare.
You are too much for my nerves.
Lost her when he had just won her!
Your ideas are wrong--wrong, I know they are.
You know what that s equivalent to?
Laxley would certainly insult him!
Do you intend to carry on this folly, Jack?
Thinks to frighten me into submission!
No, Carry: I do not jump into ditches for nothing.
Why the devil don't they serve me like that
They must be cowards, so there isn't much to fear.
Why the deuce are you running away?
I'll wager she has the old Dip.
down on his knee before she cuts.
Still more astonished, Your brother!
this sun is too powerful for you.
My mother is sleeping, her ladyship remarked.
The fellow's ashamed of himself-ha!
Tell me, Evan,--it is not true.
His Gods have fought for him, and there he is!
But he does not ask it of you, the callous Pagan!
Do you know, I think I am older than your brother!
Andrew fumed and sneered at Tailordom.
While Evan was replying, her face became white.
You told him we were jobbers and swindlers, sir!
He swallowed his laughter like oil on his rage.
Thy sufferings are severe--but such is woman!
My tragedy is, then, thy farce!
But that isn't the worst, Franko!
I was a fool-a scoundrel, if you like.
that fellow's name's always on your tongue.
Because, my dear, she is enamoured of his person.
I know better: it is his person.
Beckley Court may be lost by a shabby coat!
Oh, I could swear at that brother!
If not to Perdition--Tailordom!
Pay for it with years of remorse!
You are a donkey to wear it, said Evan.
I would have let you do it once, but-- Stuff!
Didn't think you were man enough.
She was willing, only-- Only--eh?
Days the poor thing kept crying!
I ve knocked that fellow over once, he said.
If I am not loved, then let me die!
Guiltless, and gloriously guiltless!
Am I such a coward, inconstant, cold?
I will wipe out the injustice I did him.
God bless your soul, you little darling!
A wife's a wife, I say--hang it!
What a likeness between you and your mother.
And a fool in his business to boot, dear!
Once, that member would have blistered.
He said: Gad, I never kissed you in my life, Louy.
It wasn't your mouth, Louy, said Andrew.
And, oh, be charitable, matrons of Britain!
For my sake, I beg it, Ferdinand.
then you won't suit me as well as your mother.
We are poor insignificant people!
Can we, unless you bend a little?
Such a very poor one, Countess!
Her sufferings will one day be terrible.
That absurd report is all nonsense.
AMMIANI'S INTERCESSION V. THE SPY VI.
IN VERONA X. THE POPE'S MOUTH XI.
AMMIANI THROUGH THE MIDNIGHT XVI.
Milan has made me sick of late.
I like the look of that fellow.
Now, listen--Viva Carlo Alberto!
If you confound it, he takes you for an enemy.
He has swallowed enough of Austrian bread.
He took an Austrian wife to his bed.
The spies are stifling down below.
We've had enough of this lad, said Corte.
and Austrian as good as Italian.
I spit upon their polluted cheeks!
They get us an ill name wherever they go.
I heard the white demon myself.
Her object in coming, my friend?
But you are wrong in this case, my Beppo.
You trust to Milan, and you are fore-doomed.
I would swear it with this hand in the flames.
The keen French wit is sick of its compromise-king.
Such as you will help to give our Italy freedom.
Are they fools?--they must see through it.
You are positively slaying a victim.
I beg you all to look at the case calmly!
You are going to the slaughter.
think of the rough hands, and foul mouths!
She does not require to be excited.
Listen, in the name of saints and devils!
You want frightening, my pretty fellow!
Luigi, you will be a spy no more?
Yes, signorina, it is true; I am a spy on you.
You go nowhere else, except to the maestro's.
I do not sing Italia, Italia shall be free!
he says
Oh, Barto, Barto, she is rarest in Milan!
Barto paused, calculatingly, eye on victim.
May the devil seize you when you're sleeping!
Now you know:--gave me a cigarette
She gave you a cigarette, and you smoked it; ha!
What's the use of your skewering me with your eyes!
a night out of my life like an old jaw-tooth.
The treacherous cur lies rotting in a ditch!
I write coldly; I am tired, and forget my English.
The woman appeared and bound Luigi's eyes.
He had been twice betrayed by women.
She could have hanged him, had it pleased her.
Barto Rizzo does not keep his appointments, then!
They will call you a mercenary soldier.
You are with a band of butchers.
Count Broncini smote him on the face.
I receive your denial, my children.
They say, tis as ready to flash out as your temper.
Count Paul is with her, from Bologna.
Luck to the lads we leave behind!
Spies are doubled, troops coming.
remember your bet
I've marched and messed with Prussians--with oxen.
They say she's charming, and very pert.
I do not interchange letters with Germans.
cried Ammiani, panting to let out his wrath.
An indiscretion is possible to woman, my lad.
A revolutionary symbol!--my dear!
Ammiani bent over to Vittoria's ear.
I mean this man, this devil, Barto Rizzo.
She did not speak to foreigners.
Laura mine, I am for ever thy AMALIA.
in her own language, and No, no!
I am for Austria, you are for Italy.
Luigi and the saints watch over you.
And now you're meek as a mouse.
And they call you a clever fellow!
Silence, engine that you are, and not a man!
No
She wants to be kindled on fire.
till you are beaten, till you gasp Love!
But you are good enough for the people.
It is you, Herr Captain von Weisspriess!
Abjure it, or you make no way with this mad thing.
She's a nice little wild woman to tame.
You're not a fighting man, Pericles.
One is in my way, I have him put out of my way.
Now, tell me, kind, good, harsh old master!
I can fancy the tremble going all down your legs.
My madman, she called this latter.
The man was an Austrian soldier.
You make a woman try to deceive you.
She is my pretty puppet-patriot.
Beast or man, devil or whatever you are!
She writes love-letters to an English whitecoat.
She is the puppet of an English Austrian!
After that I shall deal with you.
These two were boys under twenty.
Gentlemen, I cannot be more explicit.
Italy revived in these mothers.
Nay, my son; but you are one of them.
He imperils more than all of you.
Oh, for ever Agostino with you young men!
She has been false to her Art, false!
She is now away-off--out of sight--the perfule!
Listen, you pair of Nuremberg puppet-heads!
Lift not that curtain, you Pannonian burglars!
what a thing is hurry to a mind like mine.
Do you know that the Pope's Mouth is closed?
Has he only gone too far, do you say?
Your prima donna celestissima is out of harm's way.
Well
She is vinegar--we will mix her with oil.
were I a Goddess, my wounds would heal.
I am no Goddess, and no Saint: yet I cannot die.
They flow to wash out my shame.
I looked my mother in the face.
Do you see that your uncle is signalling to you?
We are victims already, my Agostino.
The Gods, my dear General, decree.
And you do not think much of her voice, General?
He is inexorable, being the guilty one of the two.
You have been educated for monarchy.
If you are despoiled, we will share with you.
When I have seen her safe; not before, he said.
she dissembles so magnificently ever!
on thy lying brow Thy name shall be imprinted now.
MICHIELLA (torn with jealous rage).
Yea
Put poison in their latest breath!
MICHIELLA (spurning verbal controversy).
soldiers I strike them down, the pair!
The tablets of the tomb defiest!
Your palsied hands refuse their swords.
Die then, and outrage me no more.
For you, my husband, lies a flaming way.
see the fallen eyelids of a saint.
They, with the Italians, said: Hear her!
I wish our sweet boys would cry louder.
he said
Swiftly, gentlemen, or she's lost.
Giacinta had to be as a mother with her.
Drown yourself if a second frenzy comes.
You beat us Germans on one field.
On the other you have no chance.
Lady, I am your obsequious servant.
She read: Keep watch on this Austrian.
Refuse to be separated from me.
My life is at your service.--Beppo.
When he released her she was perfectly mastered.
You look too gentle to give them cause.
She is not the mother I love and I serve.
I can promise to keep you warm, signorina.
Lorenzo, may you rot like a pumpkin!
he observed
He repeated that she was born on a hired bed.
He's only a middling lover, signore.
And a cur, a traitor, carrion, said Angelo.
With the utmost reverence, I quit you.
Do you know Barto Rizzo, padrone?
I'm sure you wouldn't know such a fellow.
I pinch her, and she beats me, and we are equal.
Ah, padrone, he said: I'm done for; leave me.
If I do leave you, I must cut out your tongue.
Give him knuckles, and break his back, my boy!
Padrone, you dismiss me now, said Jacopo.
Stout men are doomed to the obscurer paths.
you were educated in England, I have heard.
It s because I'm a German
It is now time to draw your dagger, he said.
You shall teaze me, if it amuses you.
Am I not, now, the object of your detestation?
Angelo Guidascarpi, I also know you.
I have warned you, Captain Weisspriess.
I think you have heard that I can use my weapon.
Fortunately, we deal with brutes.
Is that the secret of their German education?
a beard indeed, for there is no end to this animal.
Would you denounce a sick man, Wilfrid?
he said, in a vehement underneath.
You have done nothing--worse than nothing.
Our Italian girls do this
I am too angry to care for music.
If you stay, you will earn my contempt.
We have to submit to these little social scourges.
After your last miserable fiasco, my dear!
You provoke it
If they think of having me alive!
can he be waiting for me to coax him?
Emilia, do you hear?--die for you!
No wonder she's shy of you now.
Now, I'll swear I'll smoke this one out.
The time'll come for it--and then, you cats!
Jenna received a blinding slap across the eyes.
Wilfrid sighed, Yes, I know you; do your worst.
It was revealed to us when we were boys.
The worms may creep on: the men must die.
we have beaten them the cravens!
You know where they're to be had.
They, my friend, are for a better cause.
I am as much Barto Rizzo's prisoner now as you are.
Thitherward his cry of Down with the Tedeschi!
Did she not visit you in prison two weeks ago?
To the devil with our days of benignity!
Are you in the pay of the insurgents?
Take me to your mother, she said.
My Sandra, you are certainly perverse.
But to be hypocritical one must be false.
Ashes are only ashes
Yet I was right in printing my young nonsense.
Genoa and Turin say, Go and try.
This is shameful, said Vittoria.
I see every feminine quality in it, my dear.
Why, it's to find you, signorina.
It is only one, but it is ONE, mon Dieu!
I have watched, I have reared her.
Not to Turin, not to London, Sandra Belloni!
Sandra, will you be a good child?
I am desolate in offending you.
Am I the person to have abuse poured on me?
The men claimed him as an Austrian spy.
The prisoner was clearly an Englishman.
You can serve as a spy, Wilfrid!
It is immonde
She loved my brother, poor thing!
The intolerable cowardice amazes me.
You belong to me
Vicenza will soon bubble on a fire, I suspect.
And when my bride is with her, I am between them.
We Italians are in a hurricane
She is wilful as a principessina: Tis so!
But to applaud the Traitor now!
He lent us his army like a Jew, for huge interest.
Carlo Alberto is quite unlike other men.
For that reason I am absent from your mother.
I reserve all sweet names for you.
Why will you not recognize facts?
All changes that please my friends please me.
They may cease to persecute me soon.
Not yet
Then she cried out, Fool that he is!
He has it, just as they all have.
Surely you have punished your bride enough?
You understand her now, do you?
Will nothing satisfy you, wilful sceptic?
Hard enough to have to mention it to you, signora!
You hate me
Look out for yourself, my child.
Yes, he said, and did not turn to her face.
Carlo, you have done worse than that.
He lifted her hand to his mouth.
Beppo then challenged his Styrian to fight.
I knew these reports were abase calumny.
It's treason, if it is not cowardice.
I worship justice, and a black deed haunts me.
But I will have them on their knees.
You have a baby's heart
She told you just now that she called you Austria.
Many are to go down because you have gone down.
What will sharpen the wits of these soldiers!
I had my warning, but I was mad.
we are three, and can fight like a pyramid.
She went on: Never, never love a married woman!
You are a more experienced woman!
I tell you I will have no nonsense.
You two, you women, are her enemies.
and to-morrow, countess, I will see my lawyer.
Irma, begone, and shriek to your wardrobe!
What dreadful fool is this I sit with?
If it is worship of swine, she cannot refuse it.
If she has not ruined him, she will.
Did you see much sacking of villages last year?
Are you relating your amours to me, rascal?
By making love to a lady's maid?
I could wish she were a devil, my Powys.
Her husband, he is a fool, ser.
I lose my temper the moment I begin to speak.
When he's dog at the gates no one can approach her.
You detestable German girls can't love.
Hear this:--I hated you as the devil is hated.
God of all the pits of punishment!
Look at me, Countess Alessandra.
She perished righteously, for she disobeyed.
She died blessing you above me.
Countess Alessandra, were you not once a traitress?
I had the divine contempt for women.
If he moves, he walks into a pit.
I beat at the bars of a cage all day.
I suffer as I deserve for it now.
Will you cause her to come before me?
I have a message from your friend Luciano.
Set the woman face to face with me!
I have her here harmless for the night.
Don't you know you've been listening to a madman?
A Piedmontese colonel, you fool!
I prefer to let Antonio-Pericles go mad.
I have never seen so abject a creature.
Shall we not enjoy what we find?
except that I have been possessed by devils.
I don't care whether they live or die.
I love my country
Insult or a wrong makes a madwoman of you.
Anna, will you let these two men go--to slaughter?
You must see her, or you betray yourself.
Tell her?--she will die, said Laura, shuddering.
AN ADVENTURE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT III.
No, sir; no fire, said Sewis; you be cool, sir.
I don't sleep so thick but I can hear, you dog!
What place here is the scoundrel soiling now?
Have you any accomplices lurking about here?
You compel her to come out to me?
You've done your worst
I keep my flock clear of a foul sheep.
I submit to any conditions: only let me see her.
Nonsense: I tell you he's a-bed and asleep.
When the boy's fast asleep, man!
it is infamous, it is a curst piece of inhumanity.
You are earthy
Mind, if you take him, he goes for good.
For God's sake, let go the boy!
Take him, and by the Lord, you ruin him.
There now, never mind, stay, down with him.
Don't you see he's not a common boy?
There was no moving on until he was filled.
Martha Thresher dosed me for liver.
And now to see the bed you have slept in.
Richest of treats, a monkey was introduced to me.
Grow tough, that's what you've got to do.
I was seized by the collar, and shakes roughly.
There's very little he hasn't daring enough for!
he went
said he, staring at us angrily.
I'd go through a regiment of sabres to get at you.
Do you dream of me in your bed?
But no, you are not going; you want to frighten me.
Oh, yes, I will kiss you, dear.
Heriot said, Your mother was Irish, Julia.
God bless you, dear little lad!
Saddlebank, I ll buy him off you, I said.
Because he's an awful goose, said Saddlebank.
I made the girl take a piece of toffy.
Gentlemen never forget their servants, Temple.
Big men can't be always looking after little boys.
On he goes, you after him, never mind what happens.
Only up to my knees, she confessed.
I repeated, in my superior pleasure.
She snapped her fingers: Mumpers!
Then I'll come and lie in the middle, said he.
It's a young woman you've got there, eh?
The girl whispered in my ear, He's lame as ducks.
Why, I know all about you, you see.
Yes, old Sewis s alive, Master Harry.
he cried in a rage, after listening to him.
Ran like a hare, stead of a fox, eh?
I'm not likely to forget his nonsense.
Expunge him, old fellow; he's no good.
Up with her in your arms or down on your knees.
See there, she s got it ready for you.
And now you think you are flattering me!
He confessed he had found me changed at first.
I'll find him, never mind what happens.
And he would not be so if not of the right stuff!
and the cause is a cruel woman.
And then at Temple, You see if I wouldn't.
I sacrificed my dog to bring Temple to his senses.
Now speak, the man said, roughly.
The saucy girl of the pair asked me for money.
She came down, the men said, like a singed turkey.
You're such a deuce of a sleeper, he said.
Only you really are under a delusion.
I love my country
Don't look at the stage-they speak such nonsense.
I have come out to find him, and I must.
Greek things don't make you feel funny.
We re as out of place here as frogs in the desert!
Oh, you won't understand what you gaze at.
there goes a fellow with a match.
You found me out
They led him away, and us to bath-rooms.
So you could bear it no longer, Richie?
We are two fools, Mr. Temple, he said.
She drew language, I protest, from the slums.
Tis the fashion with the Germans.
Heriot lost his wagers and called her a witch.
But you women like monstrosities.
I suppose she has her money in a coal mine.
Don't have this affair on your conscience, boy.
Harry, you wouldn't go and do that?
You'll be stuck in a coloured caricature!
The man must earn his bread, Richie, boy!
Purely temporary fits of unworthiness, my lady.
If Lady Wilts has me, why, she must.
The wealth of this country is frightful.
Do not, he groaned, do not force it!
Bless my soul, what is there in the world so bad?
Do you mean that by putting it on all fours?
Put your own feelings aside, my dearest.
Heaven knows what one's relatives think of one.
Here comes the mother in me pumping up.
Harry'
Such freaks were exceedingly to my taste.
None so grimly ironical as the obsequious!
Girls like my girl here are precious.
what a splendid panther she is!
old Richie, and about as much fire as a rushlight.
Ay, but compare yourself with him, Richie!
But these Belgians speak French.
She is gazing on it, and breathing it, Richie.
Her eyelids gently lifted, asking me.
But you are so, you English, when not intoxicated.
Are you besieging your Government?
Are you a purse-proud commoner or an imbecile?
The life here is as bad as in Rippau.
Now I ve given you a dose of life.
Yes, you begin to look like human flesh.
she concluded
Not while I live, madam, said he.
I pose my pride--immolate my son to it, Richie?
I might ask, is it you, princess?
Talk German when she is on guard.
I bring you to be German, you see.
Tell her to play, she plays her sweetest.
Give me time, and I'll do better things, I groaned.
You are one of the main drainpipes of English gold.
They are not a community, and are not--bad enough!
So long as it imperilled their own!
Reverence their ancestors, then!
The worse for such descendants.
By the weight of what you carry in your head.
We Germans use the night for work.
His lawyers were busy procuring evidence.
I ll ride and have some fetched to you.
I think I am going to cry like a girl.
And you endured the trial that was forced on you.
I sign it, before heaven, your Ottilia.
Your Highness, I believe I can guess it.
Taking you as a foreigner, you must know that.
Judge of the case by your own reigning Families.
I shut myself up
Ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis!
See what I wear, dear Mr. Patient!
I had dragged her down to the duellist's level!
Or if I hear her, or hear that she has come!
You have been remiss in not writing to me, child.
Great Germany, young gentleman.
But I am, whenever I hear him abused.
See there the way with your free-thinkers!
They say he has a South American complexion.
Much court was paid to him by the men.
I thank my God I am not so cool as you, said she.
There's three, and that's not enough for him.
she answered my slight innuendo.
Do you take her for a real person, Janet?
Have you noticed she gets more and more Irish?
He set out in the night You not enter it any more!
All the while he was muttering, Turncoat!
Do you find a princess objectionable, sir?
ever since she was a chick with half a feather on.
She's firm as a rock
I spied you puffing behind one t other day.
And like a fool, you think--eh?
Conquered him over the fourth bottle!
These Englishwomen are a fiction!
We've our Lady Jezebels, my boy!
The wealth of this country's frightful!
H'm, she perused my features; pale!
I invite him to London, Richie.
My temper was beginning to chafe at the curb.
I dis-sociate you from me, Richie, do you see?
Ay, through your love for your dada.
Things printed can never be stopped, Richie.
Ring him up, ring him up, Jorian.
Catch her, Jorian; you are on guard.
Now you're trifling with the second.
You re not at the end of your run, I dare say.
Jorian, your mind is in a state of confusion.
It's a bit of business, not pleasure.
What infernal nonsense . . , fellow talking now?
Between you, I defy the Court to rival you.
She took extraordinary liberties with me.
Never a man made such a fool of in his life!
Harry, I'd as lief hang on to a fire-ship.
Fellow makes the world look like a farce.
And now, squire, I have had my dose.
She blazes out, that he scandalizes her family.
Richmond, my hearty, where the deuce have you been?
too much to say for herself to suit me.
Wouldn't hurt him for the world and all Havannah.
What the deuce have you got into your head?
I am marked with a strawberry, here.
Dash it, you're a fire-eater, I know, Richmond.
We can't fight in this country
What does it matter what old Duke Fitz does?
If you fail, my success is emptiness.
The more I dare, the less dare they.
Heart sunk too low below his belt, sir.
Heriot flushed, muttering, The little devil!
The fellow facing me was unmistakably gipsy-build.
You ll be twice as long as you've been.
I didn't tie a handkercher across their eyes.
Kiomi, why the deuce did your people attack me?
I ll put you down and be off, she threatened.
Air and water's the doctor for such as you.
Why did your men pitch into me?
I was not a presentable object.
No, the biggest brutes on the earth, said I. Oh!
Not here, she said, as soon as I began to question.
And pray remember where you are.
I fancied myself vilely duped by this lady.
What the deuce did he want with a Jew?
Keep him away, bring down grandada, Harry.
Are we quite sure that his head's clean on?
But, Harry, where did you turn off that night?
He turned to me while giving directions to his man.
You ve got him down there, I suppose?
I thanked him for a thrashing in a curt reply.
can't you see through it, aunty?
Dear aunty, he s a prince, and a proud man.
He does not come within her scope, Harry.
You have wrecked my last chance.
She will not be subjected by any threats.
Tell me of her reputation, Richie.
You pretend that you can damage it!
I am a God, sir, inaccessible to mortal ailments!
Your dear mother had a low-toned nervous system.
And that reminds me you are amateur of dogs.
Denounce them--they endure for ever!
You suppose you got it from some fool?
You wrote her a letter and wrote her a lie.
The prince is a gentleman, grandada.
You waste time and trouble, grandada, said she.
So you say you tell me to go, do you?
What he will make of your grandad!
So you tell me
Address my daughter respectfully, sir, will you!
I won't have your infernal familiarities!
Mr. Beltham, he said, you are hard, sir.
From infancy---- To the deuce, your infancy!
I know too much about your age.
You pensioner of a silly country spinster!
Disown him, and I'll pay you money and thank you.
your Spanish fopperies and trickeries!
you threatened to hang yourself, guitar and all.
every inch of you s notched with villany!
Rail at me, sir, as much as you like.
It is not your abuse, Mr. Beltham.
I m ready to finish and get rid of you, Richmond.
The lady is free of you, I tell you.
Now you can look upon a game of stale-mate.
Then I whistle you off my fingers!
I have to record no pathetic field-day.
You're rather incomprehensible, my dear Janet.
No. Well, you've done your worst, my dear.
I heard that he married a second young wife.
Do you mean she found him raving?
The money is Satan in my very hands!
Tears are the way of women and their comfort.
You know me, that when I say come, it is enough.
Every soul perished, the captain and all.
UNCLE, NEPHEW, AND ANOTHER III.
A GLIMPSE OF NEVIL IN ACTION V. RENEE VI.
AN INTERVIEW WITH THE INFAMOUS Dr. SHRAPNEL XIII.
BETWEEN BEAUCHAMP AND CECILIA XL.
And imagine French Guardsmen reading it!
Men had not pleased him of late.
Messieurs de la Garde Francaise!
I do not WANT, ma'am, said Nevil.
Duelling is, I know, sickening folly.
We are English--British, he said.
Nevil behaved like a knight, I hear.
I have no dislike of Frenchmen.
You stepped out for the dogs to judge better of us.
We can fight foreigners when the time comes.
Manchester's the belly of this country!
I suppose the people of Great Britain count, sir.
The people always wait for the winner, boy Nevil.
And now came war, the purifier and the pestilence.
And a highly alluring adornment it is!
You want commanding, mademoiselle.
You consent to be extinguished.
But, I mean, a mother would not have left me.
Think of her sacrificed to this man thrice her age!
You are really in love, my poor fellow.
You do not know her, ma'am, said Nevil.
Last night you said one night, he whispered.
You are me, myself; more, better than me.
My dear Nevil, are you in a state of delusion?
Beauchamp simply replied: Come to her.
You want an altercation before these fellows?
There won't be one
The case is, that she's a child, and you?
You will know what to tell him, ma'am.
Nevil will pay through the nose.
CHAPTER XII AN INTERVIEW WITH THE INFAMOUS DR.
A bed is at your service, ma'am.
I am a fire-worshipper, ma'am, he said.
He could not injure me personally.
He could not offend me, I mean.
Was the man uncivil to you, ma'am?
Recall what Nevil was during the war.
Then why the deuce did you do it?
You still have a tinge of Africa, do you know?
Have you gone over to the enemy, Nevil?
We are Tories, you know, Nevil.
Non fu mai gloria senza invidia.
You will have to pardon me
Does one see everything in a mirror, Nevil?
You'll be beaten in Bevisham, I warn you.
I punish you by answering you seriously.
Retreat and menace, that's the motto for them.
Heaven save us from political parsons!
This was but impudent nonsense.
Is Nevil ruined with his uncle, papa?
Are not a great many lawyers Liberals, papa?
He must have lots of women there.
Do you think much of the women here?
Go to Paris in January, and cut out the Frenchmen.
for dancing, the Frenchwoman beat the Italian.
Why did you set me bowing to that old boy?
A girl like that may have what she likes.
I don't care what she has--there's woman in her.
That Sunday tyranny of yours has to be defended.
She won't let him come to these meetings.
They had no root in the people!
You have Tory, Liberal, and Radical.
The poor old Tory tortoise is nowhere.
Will you take a whip down there?
Sleep was rejected by her, bed itself.
I give you three days--no more.
You are tired, from not sleeping last night.
Noi veggiam come quei, che ha mala luce.
She cried, You have my full consent, and left them.
His historic harem was insulted.
It is for him to kneel, my dearest.
and your seven-feet high uncle?
They kept him out of the last war!
That country seems to frown on me.
Gaze on it with the eye of our parent orb!
He didn't know where he was; all abroad, poor boy.
My belief is he's a Fire-worshipper.
He's an incendiary, at any rate.
Creeds will not die not fighting.
Now, pray attend to this, colonel.
A Tyrant offers them to be directly their friend.
Never in my life have I heard such stuff.
The old communist and socialist!
Not if I have your word, ma'am.
I request you abstain from provocations with me.
Now mark, I will be plain with you.
There is no escape for you from this.
Have you taken too much wine, gentlemen?
Ay, have at me, all of you, as much as you will!
His companion pooh-poohed and said: Foh!
His last word was that he is for war with us.
Nevil, your terrible view of life must be false.
I've no doubt he richly deserved it.
and after an interval: Gallows!
He behaved badly when you saw him, did he?
You think he ought to be whipped?
Did he insult you at all, ma'am?
That will do, ma'am, he dismissed her.
I cannot say that he was not offensive.
No, but you set fire to the train.
There's no other course for you.
But you would never tell your uncle that?
So you say to sit idle: but do as I tell you.
and lie in peace, old Shrapnel!
I'm not astonished you're sick and ill.
You took her to that man's gate.
You make it hard for me to treat you with respect.
Into opening her lips wider
You went on that brute's errand in ignorance.
Hesitation about it doubles the infamy.
And he took his punishment like a man.
They can't spell
Only he has got the word people in his mouth.
You have not seen her as I have.
An old man, utterly defenceless, making no defence!
Have you forgotten Mr. Austin, papa?
The French story is untrue, papa.
No, you know too well I can't resist you.
What right have you to be lecturing and orationing?
If she comes she will hear what I think of her.
Cecil struck out his underjaw to reply: Oh!
Sailors are credulous: you know them.
The world does not stone men, said Renee.
Old women, Nevil; intriguers, tattlers.
Beauchamp closed the door on her.
Get her to eat, ma'am; you must.
Stones are easier to move than your English.
You don't study your countrymen.
And where have you arranged for me to go, ma'am?
You're never thinking of any one else, ma'am.
When he has apologized to you, I may, ma'am.
I am no match for you, my lord.
Has the rascal been questioning your conduct?
He permitted himself to sneer at you?
Time goes forward, ma'am, and you go round.
I'm afraid you've dished yourself.
So little did he understand men!
Well, if I suffer, let me think of her!
I insist on your keeping silence.
You are a woman not to break your word.
It would be impossible for you to speak the truth.
That man will employ every weapon.
It is the same with all your friends.
Now leave me, my dear Nevil, she said.
It is powerful only while subservient.
He doesn't look as if he were attracted.
Of course, papa, I would not chain you to England.
This is the sort of fellow my girl worships!
There, your cheeks are flushed.
You won't doubt if I bring you proofs.
Now I'm off, said he, and kissed her.
They're prejudiced, I dare say.
You're not dealing with an intelligent people.
Defend us from the uneducated English!
you have had a bruise on yours.
I may die
I cannot endure a second persecution.
We scoff at the simplicity of the Germans.
That you can't say of the English.
None despises the English in reality.
You went: and not a word for me!
The colonel has discovered his Tory young man!
You refuse me: you have not heard me.
It's useless to look icy: you feel what I say.
I have not even the right to listen to you.
The counter-argument, I call treason.
That, the Tory reaction is responsible for!
Now, was that abuse of the fellow?
You will get no release from him.
He is ill
Is it not a kind of cowardice to conceal it?
You don't see what frets her, colonel.
He fought to the skeleton in our last big war.
Frenchwoman or not, that affair's over.
I could strangle the world till that month's past.
Perish every consideration to avert it!
Only, my ignorance is fever; I share Nevil's.
Ignorance and suspense have been poison.
I burn to go
They will not hurt me, but relieve.
Shall fear to see you returning yet.
Ce sont les tenebres qui tuent.
You don't keep watch in the room, my dear, do you?
The world asks them to practise its own hypocrisy.
My dear girl, you are exciting yourself.
Now listen the man insulted you.
My dear saint, you're dreaming.
The man roughed you, and I taught him manners.
Yes, my dear girl, but not to act insanely.
She is driving him to it, intentionally or not.
Don't attempt to reason with me, please, please!
Language like that offends you.
Now, my dear lord, see that, and submit.
We separate ourselves from a wretch like that.
Heed not that girl, my Beauchamp.
Six men won't hurt you more than one.
And why check them when their feelings are up?
And we're the worst nation in Europe for that.
Which was the arm that bled for me?
You are not to have your hand back: it is mine.
Witness, doctor, she s mine by her own confession.
Here are more misunderstandings!
palpitated, and destroyed and re-made her.
Don't tell me he's a good fellow.
Let it go
Instantly off they scour, Egoist and imps.
The man is a Marine, but he is a Patterne.
Have you noticed that he has a leg?
He has it as Cicero had a tongue.
Constantia was called that mad thing.
Heaven forefend a collision between cousins!
It would soon be getting ridiculous.
Wives are plentiful, friends are rare.
You would not have her natural?
It is, you will allow, gross; it is a beast.
The picture once conjured up would not be laid.
I see a ring of monkeys grinning.
Kneel to Heaven, not to me, Willoughby.
Come and see me mount Black Norman.
To purchase, you must pay, my child.
We are one: the world may do its worst.
Two months hence she was a bondwoman for life!
Poison of some sort must be operating in her.
They are laughable, contemptible.
No: they will be eating themselves up.
As if I were going to lecture you, you silly boy!
It is wrong to pet a big boy like you.
Does not he what you call tip you, Crossjay?
Woman is excellent for the upper.
They won't take rough and smooth as they come.
They are society's hard-drilled soldiery.
Prussians that must both march and think in step.
He has not dealt much with children.
Only I can't prevent the lad from liking me.
She reasoned: in other words, armed her ignorance.
This is not a language I talk to the world.
It is my wish, and that arms you.
It is your wish, that subjugates him.
Know one Frenchman and you know France.
And they are the benefactors of humanity.
Beware of marrying an Egoist, my dear!
Don't, I beg you, continue to annoy me.
We are likely to have one idle lout the more.
I want to be free . . . Flitch!
Volatile, unworthy, liberty--my dearest!
The sight of that man was annoying.
Once off, off for all eternity!
At night you will go to bed, Crossjay.
If you are thinking of tyrants, it may be so.
The world has not much right to judge.
Then she would not be much of a loss.
Are you not singularly tolerant?
They are palpable, small enough.
Reprobate a weak and foolish girl's ignorance.
More offensive than debris of a midnight banquet!
Do you call our country flat, Miss Middleton?
I can imagine learning to love ugliness.
Is there any other way of punishing them?
Consider what you lose in punishing them.
The rogue has no cousin, has she?
The man had better have hanged himself, said she.
He loathed the fellow, fought the fellow.
Now let me intercede for poor Flitch.
If it pleases you
You decree me to the part of ball between two bats.
They are rather intolerant of us poor fellows.
THE IRISHMAN IN SPAIN would do.
You remind me that I have no pretension to black.
And now let me see you run fast.
We, sir, dedicate genius to the cloacaline floods.
Mulier tum bene olet', you know.
Most fragrant she that smells of naught.
Terrors of apprehension drive them.
told her she was woman and never could submit.
You expect me to be all reason!
You don't carry a comb, my man, when you bathe?
And if they capsize, why, tis a natural ducking!
Then I'm afraid they must be mortally dull.
Ay, she had the kiss, and no mean one.
There would be pangs for him too, that Third!
He would not remember that but for hateful wine!
We are vain and shallow, my dear papa.
It's the worst thing possible to work on.
The boatswain daren't strike an officer!
You are not bound to, Crossjay.
That was when Vernon lay beneath.
So you know what a delightful partner she is.
Now, take care before you open your mouth.
Crossjay shut the mouth he had opened.
But ain't it now, young gentleman?
Why, what a beast you must be, you fellow!
Just as you like, young gentleman.
And why did I swear, young gentleman?
But why are you sitting here wet through, Crossjay!
Crossjay ground his teeth at the betrayer.
But you're a Grecian, friend Vernon.
You must be wet through, Mr. Whitford.
Only you speak in irony so much.
I have no more endurance left in me.
Miss Middleton, Flitch is charioteer once more.
Flitch is to blame, if any one.
Except, pray, to advance the cause of poor Flitch!
He found her protected by Barclay on the stairs.
here you are, safe; I have you!
I have been all over the country after you.
You disperse money too liberally.
That boy must be made to feel his treason.
You have not suffered from the truth, my Clara!
No. Did Willoughby look at her?
All the means of satiating them are at my disposal.
His deceitfulness has been gross.
But the poor boy is to be expelled!
snared ever by the sparkling and frivolous!
She took a breath before she moved.
You are excluded, Mr. Whitford.
If you learn that I am a grisly Egoist?
I was curiously susceptible last night.
You brought Dr. Middleton down on you.
You have hit it perfectly, as usual, ma'am.
Her laughter was delicious
She has the kind of attraction.
Like a Jacobite lord under the Georges.
Why, she is as good as married.
These Irish or half Irishmen are my taste.
Now, did you observe him last night?
When one does get intimate with a dainty rogue!
Have you never warmed together?
You are all the sweeter to me for not being tame.
Eloquence is a terrible thing in woman.
Are you playing humble handmaid?
It's to be regretted that you are not portionless.
She told me last night she had it back.
Let me have a good gaze at you.
Your look just now was downright revulsion.
I am utterly in your hands, madam.
You have behaved badly, badly, badly.
Oh, yes; every day it's the same.
Or a baby, you might have added.
Be alert, as you were last night.
I'm too weighty, my dear friend.
Yes, yes, she is clever, of course, poor dear.
The voluble beast was created to snare women.
You work in that den of yours every day?
In there I throw off the world.
Playing ta-ta-ta-ta ad infinitum, then.
As I said, ma'am, I am an easy-going man.
He buried the woman, and I received him.
you continue to work with your pen?
You are too precious to feed the beast.
The world would know what to think.
Love gets a bad name from them.
You never loved me, you shallow woman!
I will have an answer, I am sick of evasions.
Name it
Would you have me kneel to you, madam?
It is for the privilege of seeing the last of you.
Jam ver egelidos refert tepores.
First prime your piece of artillery, my friend.
You must babble out the rest between you.
You are engaged to him, a plighted woman.
Have you gone back to your cradle, Clara Middleton?
You deny him the happiness you wish him!
Your behaviour is of that shape.
I am volatile, capricious, flighty, very foolish.
Yellowhammer, Crossjay yelled back.
Don't order me, Crossjay was retorting.
And I found you running away from him.
You're a curiosity, Mr. Crossjay Patterne.
I recollect that you set me on my legs, doctor.
We're all her friends, Crossjay.
I flatter myself I'm a Toledo when I'm wanted.
You looked it when you made a dash at my midriff.
Why, you upset her, you know, now and then.
Everything I have is on the die.
Only women besides myself have detected him.
I came, saw, and was conquered.
What is the signification of this new freak?
I am willing to satisfy you, Clara.
You tried hard to escape, indeed you did.
Did I hear him tell you to humour me, papa?
--Your feelings
And now her door is locked to me!
And your daughter the same, sir?
DALE: LADY BUSSHE AND LADY CULMER: WITH MRS.
Her door is locked to me
Mr. Dale gulped a ball in his throat.
You see the impossibility, the error!
You, and none but you, can help us.
And more astounding, she refuses him.
Old Vernon has no tongue for women, poor fellow!
I think I heard that no woman can say No forever!
That is, if we subdue the lady.
You are not to be excited, sir: compose yourself.
As good as one can have with a woman.
You have no positive knowledge of it!
You tower too high
To plant you like the flag on the conquered peak!
You have indeed been talking to papa, Mr. Whitford.
Perhaps, poor fellow, he had an excuse last night.
There was a cry of Persecuting!
Able as Satan himself, they say.
You could not have been curious about a worse one.
Yes, the looking on him sufficed.
So are we gradually self-stifled, corrupt.
Rome stagnant invited Goth and Vandal.
And you will have to be fought for.
Part of you may be shifty-sand.
Clearly you will have to be fought for.
She is mine
May the sensation never quit you!
Why will you not rise to my level and fear nothing!
Battles are won in that way: not by tender girls!
So, then, we are in your hands, child!
I jest as little as the Talmud.
She has me fast--I am netted, centaur or man.
I am your reality: all others are phantoms.
and slipped behind her defences.
Mothers and their children are too much for me!
Shall I spoil you as she spoilt me?
Lo, the reckless prophet about to marry!
They hate--hate you, hate me for thinking of you.
They will not listen
They will not, will not ever--no!
They have to be taught the stuff Alvan is made of!
No one shall treat you like that when I am near.
You can annoy, you can insult, you cannot move me.
And never will I return to you.
You shall acknowledge that you have wronged me.
Think that you are doing this for me!
She was isolated, fed like a dungeoned captive.
They are undermining her now--now--now!
Incomprehensible to you, Tresten?
Her letter may sting, it shall not dupe.
born to it!--lies like a Saint tricking Satan!
She's weak, thin, a reed; she--let her be!
You shall write that you hate him, if you hesitate!
I would rather write that I hate him.
You write, the man is now as nothing to me!
You have as much of me as is there.
Let him beckon!--So you have your warning.
She shuddered at this false Tresten.
Barely are they able to read of it.
He has never understood women--cannot read them.
She will drag him down, down, Tresten!
She has him by the worst half of him.
Alvan has been tricked by her colour: she's icy.
Take her on the light in it, she is perfection.
There you have Clotilde: she's a TO-MORROWER.
You read her as she is when away from me.
she cannot, she will not refuse.
I have my clear judgement, I am not an imbecile.
She is all young heaven and the mountains for me!
coloured like a lantern in a cavern, good Lord!
I can't; she makes me feel too old, said Alvan.
Days like these are the days for her to be out.
Does she hint at rewarding him for his trouble?
Did you repeat her words to him?
Hard for any man to bear!--Alvan of all men!
He'd have been alive now if he had been left alone.
Leczel is with him and gives him head.
You would be above it, if you had.
It is the dark goddess Fortune to the craven.
Alvan had resolved to sweep him off the earth.
REDWORTH AND THE EXTERIOR OF MR.
It can be read maliciously, but abstain.
Tony to me, Diana to the world.
the General was Irish to the heels that night.
a man had me by the waist, and I dying to find you.
Yes, that s their way, that s their way!
Wherever the man is tried, he said.
Dan Merion would make her Irish all over.
But your voice or mine, madre, it's one soul.
REDWORTH, AND THE EXTERIOR OF MR.
that's the fellow's name he heard close at his ear.
Would a soft slap o the cheek persuade you, sir?
If you fight, you're a donkey for doing it.
But the burlesque Irishman can't be caricatured.
I have discovered that I can be a tigress!
Where was the man fitly to mate her!
This was her unconscious act of reprisal.
I have questioned myself--it is not cowardice.
I have my natural weapons and my cause.
Scorn other counsel--the coward's.
And down heer'll be no better soon, I tells em.
It's the Devil come up and abroad ower all England!
That's a crown for any dwellin!
Owner of such a woman, and to lose her!
Can you resist her appeal to you?
Did it matter whether the flames consumed her?
Let me be myself, whatever the martyrdom!
What is the husband of a vanward woman?
You are not quite yourself to your friend.
When we have a man for arbiter, he is our sky.
You will judge whether he disrespects me.
You address a faulty person, my dear.
Open your eyes to what it involves.
Let him go his ways, do his darkest, or repent.
She had not the heart to think the writers donkeys.
My dear, he was also a double-dealer.
This is the creature you try to excuse!
And that touches only their nerves.
Designing slumberers are such infants.
He told me you were the Damon and Pythias of women.
Court her, if ever you come across her.
Do not breathe London or Paris here on me.
If you stoop to tickle them, they will applaud.
He called her a perverted Celimene.
in the irritating tone of dozens of others.
I caught a girl with a bad fit on her once.
The bridge at night is a bath for a public man.
. . . In either case, she has been badly used.
Society is big engine enough to protect itself.
She would have gone under, but for you, dear Tony!
But now I see that the sin is cowardice.
Am I really as dull as a tract, my dear?
I did it last night in that time.
You can't breathe this atmosphere!
The fellow's as cold as a fish.
They've no such thing as mutton, ma'am.
Men have the trick, infants their fevers.
He has no female relations, it appears.
If I hear one word more of it, I leave the country.
When they parted, she kissed her Tony many times.
They would be hateful--baseness!
Here I cannot--if I am to be persecuted.
You shall live, my darling Tony.
I shall not be in the way, ma'am.
Women are guilty of such unreasoning acts!
A luckless member of the fraternity too!
A common donkey compared to her!
My oath on it, she won't quiver a muscle!
She s the loyallest woman anywhere.
She would have gone to heaven and left me!
Now he saw the beast he was: a filthy beast!
It is the devil, think as you like of it.
I fear I was born godmotherless.
He was wounded
There's no checking of maniacs.
Coward, take up your burden for armour!
Then the Turk is a sapient custodian!
Rank me one of the populace then!
you will go down ignorant to your grave!
Socially a Mussulman, subject to explosions!
They know nothing of us whatever!
Women have to walk with a train.
It is ill serving a mad sovereign.
Vain to be shrewish with the world!
For I am not one of the lecturing Mammonites!
It makes me a loathsome hypocrite.
Dangling and swinging day and night!
No
And she was never prudish, only self-respecting.
And you think me a romantic object?
You are not afraid of the streets at night?
Deeper within, an unmasked actress, she said.
You are not afraid of the streets, you tell me.
They have their feelings, ma'am.
She forgave
The thing's bad enough to bear as it is.
But where did you go last night?
He sneered constantly at my stale information.
Then you sold me to a journalist for money?
Or else I am subject to lose my reason.
She was guilty, and he condemned her.
Enough that the brute facts justified him.
But was she not a shameless traitor?
So ends a life of misery, my dear!
Diana's bedroom door was opened slowly.
She's down with a cold, you know.
I fancy I ought to know women by this time.
I am down there where they burn.
. . . any amount of insult, meek as gruel!
I tell him, he has no sense of national pride.
Tom Redworth is not a patriarch, my dear.
Your batting is with the tongue.
Poetic men take aim at maidens.
This was her pretty piece of work!
Well, it's cheap, it ain't bad; it's cooling.
And a scoundrel like that fellow Wroxeter!
The cur said it to a woman--hang the woman!
And she's a fire-ship; by heaven, she is!
And a black-leg cur like Wroxeter!
Or she was obscured, and he felt the face.
It's always a pleasure to see her.
Idleness is the devil--or mother of him.
I d swear she only waits for asking.
But you're not the man to be refused.
You're her friend--her champion.
You're feeling it now, on the rack, by heaven!
There is the mother for such chicks!
I can't say much for a bilious temper.
I will take your arm here, she said.
You withdraw your hand--was I rough?
If all Englishmen were like him!
DISCLOSES A STAGE ON THE DRIVE TO PARIS XV.
And none of your dam punctilio, said the man.
No, but one doesn't like being beaten by anything!
on his, a troop of mercenaries!
They do not smile on the condemnable.
That will teach you to catch at the drug.
You have not yet seen all I ve done there.
You reserve it for your enemies.
You've been a bulwark to your friends.
the woman has threatened it before.
She won't be touched, and she won't be driven.
Consider: she HAS used the rod.
She must be tired out--if human.
And the kind of reward she gets?
I am bound to defend it, clumsy bludgeon or not.
Where, do you imagine, she would lay it?
Moulding itself on her swelling proportions.
They're Society's trusty rock-limpets, no doubt.
There's not a Frenchman alive to match her.
Good, but when do we reach your level?
You two hate a man at all serious.
And he doesn't bore with his knowledge.
But, my goodness, you are wet through!
Her age might count twenty-eight: too long!
Skepsey's head dropped lower, he went as a ram.
Suppose we are not prepared?--We soon get that up.
Allow me to say, you would not touch me.
Ever had the worse of an encounter, sir?
The French are in a state of feverish patriotism.
They are inconscient, real fits.
You don't read that olfactory literature.
By the way, you haven't wealth--you have me.
You were fined for your inability to quite see.
This boxing of yours is a positive mania, Skepsey.
. . . that is, not the respectable ones.
And if the worst happens, we go down together.
Nataly heard him at night, on a moan: Poor soul!
You've heard Colney Durance abuse old England.
Have you seen anything offensive to you?
Her dropping breath was audible.
Ecstasy answered in the female voice.
Hem'd fool I am to keep appointments!
by George, your friend's gizzarded me for the day!
She will not have it
Think what you can good of her, by all means!
Only I do say it deserves to be called abominable.
And I am made of flesh, I admit it.
Leave the tussle with that woman to me.
Absurd, that sending of Jarniman!
Are you aware of anything, dear?
She heard the soft regular breathing.
They're donkeys till we know them for prophets.
You and I always have the same tastes, Fredi.
I like to see him with you, she said.
Nataly could have cried: Snake!
Now for the country, now for free breathing!
All fancies and internal communications left her.
Handsome now, she must have been beautiful.
Unguiltily tainted, in herself she was innocent.
I'm your British Jury for, a woman's.
I wish to serve you, in every way.
What a life for a man like Dartrey, at Brighton!
Shall they return to their Great Britain indignant?
A funny and a naughty reason, was it?
She is different, if you are alone with her.
You would not be ridiculous to me.
God help you!--I am excited to-day.
I know I would never do you harm.
Your mother would not like me to call you Nesta!
They make me shut
At the worst, they are sisters!
Your mother comes down to consult with you.
Most probably because he has not written, papa.
When last you left England, I kissed your hand.
I have it like a snake's bite night and day.
And I can't be crying for the end either.
So the sycophants are sure of posts!
There are lots to flatter her, Skepsey!
You never made love to me, never!
I call myself a fool--I'm a lunatic.
Positively, you are to go; and it's my command.
Don't you see you have to do with a flint!
I shall burn with shame when I think of it.
They say a woman hates if she's refused.
I saw the kind of cloud in her.
Blame me as much as you like: I do myself.
It won't punish, and it won't let you.
To confound the innocent with the guilty!
It is criminal, a reduplication of the criminality!
He says, the Germans despise us most.
You are not to mind your looks.
They worship at a niche in the wall.
He allowed, that she could not be quite gay.
Superior to his official parasites, one supposes!
That Demerara Supple-jack, Victor!
They struck the maid adored by Skepsey.
They're the scandal of our streets.
We may wash, trim, purify, but we must not maim it.
Ignorant of the character of the dreadful woman?
Ah, if I could ever in anything think her ignorant!
This woman is a rod on my back.
. . . behaviour, talk-her English.
You're not wanting in courage, Nesta.
She was mentally phrasing before she said: Absence.
My own mother!--my poor mother!
A good mother's view is not often wrong.
I feel strong when you press it.
Pray, go, dear, her mother said.
I harped on Major Worrell: my daughter insulted.
They are banned by self-respecting readers.
Nataly said to him publicly: I come too.
Your sight requires protection.
Once she was all for him and our girl.
Rough soap for a thin skin, Victor.
I left her straining for breath.
On that day, Victor breathed his last.
EXHIBITS EFFECTS OF A PRATTLER'S DOSES VIII.
Go to bed, was one of his terrible stings.
There was a notion that Matey despised girls.
That was fun to set boys jigging.
She became nearly black in their minds.
I hate duelling, but I side with my brother.
Expects to have to fight them all the same.
We must turn to the boys for justice, then.
Name your day for this man, this editor.
Women have won round fools to give way in that way.
Ormont can't swallow the woman, I'm told.
Trying, if one is bound to get her down!
She must be a blinking moll-owl!
His cheeks are as red as yours now you're blushing.
We have him sitting on our pariah.
Boys and women go on their instincts.
Supposing a certain woman to be one of the fools?
You'll see when you mustn't offend.
Give him head, he can be civilization's devil.
He goes through a campaign daily.
I say he is an unreadable sphinx.
The void of Justice is a godless region.
I can scarcely pretend to that, ma'am.
Here in London she must have a duenna.
Aminta will enjoy the switch of steel.
Invasion can't be done, they say!
I will remember . . . when I call you out.
All I can tell you is, I know boys.
And you are not speaking seriously.
You drove him out of me the day I saw him.
Is that the way with a boy, Mr. Secretary?
These English ll have their lesson.
Anything's better than loutishness.
They think me a hard old woman.
There'll be a nice explosion one day soon.
You try to provoke me
Messenger informs her, fear of internal hemorrhage.
she was angrily spurned and silenced.
Undoubtedly, she dislikes the vicious.
She said good-bye to cowardice.
I like him, but I could slap him.
I must redden if you keep looking at me so closely.
You wouldn't hesitate to fire
They ll have their day for repentance yet.
That was the best thing an old woman could hear.
They ve lost their stomach for any other.
They go as they are driven, or they resist.
Undoubtedly he could crush her.
I ve done my utmost to fire his marrow.
Spur, you dolt, or she'll be out of sight.
You have been shamefully used, madam.
Where did you say they got out, you dog?
I don't want to hear her gibberish.
or will he have her fast and tight?
Mortals have no business to interfere.
That done, we may, if we please, dominate her.
I wonder whether they have consciences!
If you had swallowed them, you'd have to disgorge.
You will submit to the summons of my lawyers.
You're bent on a public scandal, are you?
You will behave yourself when you call.
A truly dismal, profitless wrangle!
I would rather they were burnt.
No, you guess wrong this time, you clever shrew!
All women were eclipsed by her.
Anguish balanced pleasure in them both.
She had to be the hypocrite or else--leap.
You won't be seeing much of her.
A woman's innocence has a rainbow skin.
Any reasonable person must think it.
She smote a pang of her ecstasy into him: Ask mine!
You were looked for last night.
I may play--not you: you play with a weak vessel.
I have conversed with your mother.
Aminta, my beloved, if you are free, I claim you.
I don't think the just would condemn us heavily.
The society you've given her, I won't meet.
You ll be running at her heels next.
I can't see my brother look like that, and not ask.
I am a soldier, fresh from Monte Video.
We come to the grounds of my misbehaviour.
It follows, I was a liar and a traitor.
But, to myself; I was that mean fellow.
If any one can make a man of him, you will.
THE RED WARNING FROM A SON OF VAPOUR XL.
There you may see a truly terrible man.
If not incarcerated, she was rigidly watched.
Keep your tears for the living.
By the way, don't expect much of your uncle.
Handsomer than your brother, my girl.
I'll pay Anton to stick to him.
So that they may not think me so ignorant, brother.
Baden will detain my cousin full a week.
She would not have her reason in consenting.
This music burst out to mock me!
They never last long enough with me.
One does not meet a man like you every day.
Have your fling
Men were around her, forming a semi-circle.
and discomposed his argumentative mind.
If I believed in Black Arts, upon my word!
The rarest thing men teach women to feel for them!
Here, come, no, by Jove, you, Mr. Woodsir!
If you pull!--what the deuce do you want?
I'm at your mercy, you brute; caught in a trap.
I apologize for abusing you
And, upon my soul, I could drink ditchwater!
You are not in a position to be so charitable.
Not love, do you say?--you look it.
She has repeated them to me here in my bedroom.
I have seen his lips form wife.
Why mention Russett's nonsense to me?
She still wears the kind of afterglow.
Your lordship's obedient servant, FLEETWOOD.
Admiral Baldwin inquired: Bride inside?
And he's a lucky dog, if he knows his luck.
She spared him one whip, to cut him with another.
His behaviour was instructing her.
English weather and women, he says.
You may double your bets, Chummy.
I'd back you for your luck blindfold.
We slept here last night, you know.
You wouldn't have the odds, if he weren't.
If she was not there, he would leave his excuses.
Here and there the thing has been found in women.
The madder the world, the madder the fun.
Got to watch over you and your lady.
Oh, he's well, he will do; he's nothing.
Your reason for playing, poor lad?
The tippler's fumes in his head!
His mother was a South Wales woman.
I and Sarah sleep together in the room next.
You've taken to this lady, he said.
I believe she's happier with us girls.
The messenger, the butler said, was no gentleman.
Flings her off the day he married her!
It s a slap in the face to all of us.
She was wine and no penalty to me.
Be very quiet
I can't rest for that Whitechapel of yours.
You left her, and she did her best to follow you.
Anything to escape from the Church!
She has a brother living, I remind you.
You are not yourself, Lord Fleetwood.
You don't improve as you proceed.
It is visible enough then:--and O men!
Dexterous contriver, he undoubtedly is.
I heard her my husband and saw his face.
He don't mean to hurt her
My mistress wanted to be the one.
I've got a mistress to look after.
No, not like a dog, as men say of us.
She'd die for him this night, need were.
This matrimony's a bad business.
and, Does it mean my lady wants a fly?
He thinks me a frightful woman.
No more--the next line would be bleeding.
Could that woman resist seductions?
Much tasted, they turn and bite the biter.
She shall have all the distractions we can offer.
She feared the Jesuit in your friend.
Hating the mother, he would not love her boy.
You have no fear of the men, I know.
The man I do not think a bad man.
My boy makes a coward of his mother.
A young woman in her prime, you Madge!
If you ain't a girl to wallop the wind!
You make me break out at my pores.
Don't drink or you'll have your paytron on you.
Stick to that as long as your paytron consents.
And can only just read, and can't spell.
He's a lucky little one to have that mother.
Well, your mistress has that beauty.
She has only to discontinue maddening.
Don't be a prosy dog, Gower Woodseer.
It's your one chance of keeping sane.
If I have to speak a truth I m boorish.
You dirt your hands, hit or miss.
You're a milder boor when you smoke.
Lay on, then, as hard as you like.
You want me to flick your indecision.
No wonder his diction was poor.
The men are all right, they would not hurt a child.
Children of the poor have happy mothers.
He put me before him and drilled me.
there is that one child bitten.
Lose not one minute, Mr. Edwards.
You don't know these excitable people.
You may be proposing gratuitous agony.
Griffiths may keep his head
You ll find yourself in a nest of Furies.
Now she, proposes to burn the child's wound.
She has the voice poor people like.
Kit hitched and huffed away, threatening bottles.
Sharp air for a child, isn't it?
Poor little wretch has died--died raving.
Ah, and then would he dare hint, as base men will?
She said: I do, and gave him plain look for look.
let her have what comes to her.
Carinthia saw her brother tickled and interested.
You are the mistress to invite or exclude.
You may feel the cold, my lord.
A pipe is pleasant dreams at command.
Do but listen to the stuff we are maundering!
More old Brosey wins, the wiser he gets.
Their sparkle was transient
She s cool as a marble Venus, as you said.
But then, there's a manner of hitting back.
The kind of woman to send the shaft.
The Reveller's Aurora, you called her.
Tell her I depute you to kiss my son for me.
She declares you're incorruptible.
Why guess at this rascal more than another?
See a higher than your own head, good sir.
She has given proof she s a good girl.
That attack on the Welshman's the bad lookout.
We must down on our knees or they.
He was here to feel her presence in her absence.
Anything to get to that girl of his!
Empty of it, she is devil's bait.
Least of all men, I, Carinthia.
But there are rascals in this country, too.
I would pray to be spared seeing them.
I can't regret you are a mother.
God knows what you may save me from!
My brother is a courteous gentleman, my lord.
Good-bye to you, my lord, she said.
A female Meek had eighty-nine years in this life.
He handed her the rod to chastise him.
You are not to think her wild, my lord.
He belongs to the order of primitive people.
Out there in the war she is protected.
He has got rid of one to take up with a viler.
Her husband hated her brother
I don't pretend I was the perfect fool.
They suppose it the wine for their beautiful woman.
We have to be burnt to come to our senses.
He tossed me to his dogs
she was merciless, she was a witch.
If ever queen-witch was, she was the crowned one!
The Saxon trooper runs headlong to flesh.
I'll pay a visit to their breeding establishments.
That's Captain Con, I think, and many like him.
Some of them are hurt if you call them Welsh.
Saxon and Norman are still their enemies.
Say the worst of them, they are soundheaded.
He seems more Irish than his brother.
She's a friend worth having, lost to Ireland.
They will favour you with provocation.
Half-breeds are the ruin of colonists.
I'm only interpreting the people, sir.
You don't care for her any more, Philip?
Maybe they re both Irish, then?
It signifies she's cold in her bed.
But they won't try to understand our people.
Your humorous rogue is not half so taking.
unless when you see him standing immortal meek!
Boy born Vienna doctor smiling nurse laughing.
Let them play Vesuvius down there.
You won't engage yourself by coming.
Bother his wig, if he calls himself Law.
Sophistries of any description, I detest.
But she was talking to a soldier!
You'd a right to cut him up at once, Forbery.
And there you have the symbolism of your country.
She was easily appeased, too easily.
and we will let you know you have a stomach.
Furiously we disagree with you.
We are in you to lead you or work you pangs!
Hereditary hatred is approved by critical disgust.
And aren't you the same and worse?
The maids of his Church do not espouse her foes.
Then he's coming all right, is he?
You deserve them, if ever girl in this world!
There's nothing she's not capable of aiming at.
These officers bear illness well.
Reap the rich harvest of your fall to earth.
Appreciate her, sir, or perish in my esteem.
We think her a good-looking girl.
Soldiers are desperate creatures.
Thrilling to kindness, and, poor soul!
We have warned you, Fraulein Groschen!
it was Satan himself I could swear!
Look at the men of Linz now to what they were!
if old scores could be rubbed out on his hide!
Ruin smokes in that ruffian's track.
and nothing will from such godless devourers.
Others have been martyred, and were yet acceptable.
Down with her, and no more drivelling!
exclaimed Gottlieb, jumping with rage.
May you die as rich as an abbot!
I'll see, too, if the laws allow this villany!
You wouldn't shut out your nearest kin?
This'll sharpen you, my jolly King Paunch!
My name s Schwartz Thier, and so s my nature!
the daughter of Gottlieb Groschen?--Rascals!
I ll hang you, every hag's son!
He does not understand you now, Farina.
I have kissed your hand, dearest of God's angels!
What are you talking and capering at, fellow?
I am enamoured of fleshly anguish and martyrdom.
I faith, moon-struck and maid-struck in one!
He'll be asking for his head soon.
he cried; no further harm shall hap to you, man!
the dog has some right on his side.
O birdie, and boar, and deer, lie tame!
I feel friendly with these German lads.
Dear, sweet-mannered men they are!
Do you call my champion handsome, aunt?
And the writing said: SWEETEST MAIDEN!
Now he is in trouble-in prison.
They're curious, the old women, curse em!
And the young, for that matter.
Her neck's silver, and her hair gold.
and her cheeks roses, and her mouth-say no more!
They say he spoke of her last night.
I may well watch, and think for thee as for a dog.
I keep a book of them Down There!
I give them all they want, aha!
Persuade yourself you're dreaming.
Admirably-Benignant-Down-looking Highness That!
Instantaneous riddance of thee from face of earth.
No. You're more than a match for me.
By the breath of your nostrils
Do you know that fellow squatting there?
Look you--what's your lockjaw name?
I knocked the devil out of him early this morning.
What has his belly done to offend him?
a meal for a Kaiser, the brute.
and let me see the fellow that thinks evil of it.
A Swabian blockhead, aren't you?
Act as I tell you, or I'm for Cologne.
You will see her, and die under her eyes.
Sweet, deep, disaster-toning nightingale!
Oh, young bird of heaven in that Devil's clutch!
Monk or no monk's leave, she's mine.
There's a lesson for you not to cross me, children!
We kissed her, all of us, for the fun of it.
Vanity has wrecked me, in this world and the next.
I am the victim of self-incense.
Satan, my son, fights not with his fore-claws.
But he gave me easy victory, to inflate me.
You are leagued with him, then, sirrah!
could ye not leave Satan alone?
He answered: A poor youth, unconquerable Kaiser!
That is she, unconquerable Kaiser!
Said he: Gracious Kaiser and master!
General, you ran away from me this morning.
She shall be, she will, dear madam.
I say, my life is devoted to you, dear madam.
At present it is enough that I dislike it.
he decided from his experience of her.
You are seductive in your flatteries, General.
Undoubtedly your ladyship is correct.
Now, said he to himself, I know the worst!
Such an end for a conquering man was too pathetic.
I-I-I never know when I am not looking a fool.
To allow her to wound you so seriously!
Where have you left your girl, General?
But, silly, simple man that you are!

You have to be on the defensive from that moment.
I would have challenged the goddess!
You would say, kennel dogs that bay the moon!
So I have to deal with a cavalier!
Distrust us, and it is a declaration of war!
Oh, Mr. Beamish, I shall expire.
You're dark, I'm fair; we shall suit.
And if anything happens, it is to be your fault.
Only, don't let me be fingered at.
She muttered, Be made fun of--made a fool of!

And what did his mother do to him?
Couldn't you join Chloe, Mr ....
Caseldy's rich masculine matched it.
Handsome Susie knows what we want.
You're keeping Chloe waiting, sir.
You will learn to excuse them, madam.

Hateful, hateful business of the spy!
Very humbly, most earnestly, I beg your departure.

You are excused by me for all your errors, Caseldy.

I don't want help, I can undress myself.
Could it be a hand that her touch had slid across?
You'll have to stump up your part.
You're as good as mayor of this town, I hear?
You're going to Court, I'm told.
You men attach so much importance to wine!

I don't like you the worse for it.
Has your daughter engaged herself, sir?
I feel it still, and in the morning it'll be worse.
Hang me, if I know when ever we were!
You mean me, ma'am, bellowed Tinman.
He has been threatening me, and then smoothing me.
It was annoying to see this intruder.
I suppose you have no business with me?
She doesn't stomach leaving me.
You have provoked me
Now, rejoined Tinman, I am offended.
The wrong side of my mouth, my friend.
Hang your power over me, as you call it.
The treatment did not always agree with his males.
But Mart Tinman would stop, the fool!
I don't think I'm very wet, I'm cold, said Tinman.
I worked hard, I exposed my life, and all in vain.
You deserve Mr. Pollingray's ridicule.
Mama, I can't move; wait a minute, only a minute.
You would make a saint lose his temper, Mr. Amble.
Mr. Pollingray's name is the worst thing about him.
I know the sort of young man he must have been.
Mr. Pollingray may think what he likes of me.
And what does he say if I continue to complain?
But, you have not heard the worst.

And I have it planted under my nostrils eternally.
ASTRAEA: Oh, he has good looks.
Just a little maddening to hear.
And you were the worst offender.
He fed gobble-gobble on your puffs of incense.
ARDEN: I will not even think you barbarous.

All the fear is, that you trifle, Feigning them.

He'll work us ill, depend on that.
I know them too well, the villains!

He said it to the wrong person, mother.
But now, I can't stand it any longer.
You've been pining for her all this time.
You won't be able to get away from it.
These fellows are so persuasive, you see.
I hate them, she said, pointing to the latter.
Zora was a woman
I'd get rid of him if I were you.
I've got a revolver in my room.
He looked at her from afar, banteringly.
The fragile creature's air was so pathetic.
You deserve to be on the free list for life.
I'll run you both over to Nice, said Clem Sypher.
She mightn't care for it, he said.
I think they call it stowing the swag.
If I tried to do it they would lock me up.
The preposterous absurdity of the suggestion!
You have lost the train--thank goodness.
I really believe you're made of sawdust.
Afterwards she married a butcher.
He acted like a Salvini and sang like an angel.
The ulterior motive you suggest is repulsive.
Why are you so bent on educating me?
I'm tired for the only time in my life.
I've never wanted a human being before.
Now that's just what I enjoy doing.
You don't mind my looking you up?
You were destined for a more enlightened planet.
You think they are going to whip creation?
I believe you'd let me, she said, yielding.
I think you're the obtusest man I've ever met.
Do anything, except go to sleep, said Sypher.
Haven't you any sense of what you're doing?
I think it's everything that is most abominable.
It cost you a lot to say that to me.
You have everything to do with my success.
Have you ever said that to another woman?
Proceed to Naples and chastise him?
I haven't been spying on you, he explained.
Leave me alone, for God's sake.
I don't want you of all people to get on my nerves.
If I die on the road, so much the better.
Every bit of it has been worse than the last.
You see you're not a bit of use now.
I'm sure they'll make me very comfortable, ma'am.
I did say that, ma'am, I tell you straight.
No. Such a silly thing as running away.
Do you think we need begin now, ma'am?
Don't you think you're just a bit--egotistical?
And then get rid of me as soon as possible?
No one has ever looked to me in all my life.
Her inner world was tragical enough, poor child.
I shall never understand this country!
You're too good for me, and I'm hateful.
I know it, and it drives me mad.
I suppose you would do anything for her.
Have a drink first before I tell you.
I was forgetting my own infernal blister, said he.
Her lips were soft and her breath was sweet.
No woman save his mother had ever kissed him.
If you look like that, Shuttleworth, I shall cry.
It talks all day and does nothing all night.
I've never seen a child with so little nose.
He's a lazy scoundrel, said Sypher.
Emmy isn't fit to educate a rabbit.
And I guess you're doing the same.
One might just as well be a fossil oneself.
He hasn't changed a bit since you left.
What an exasperating thing you are!
Now his gods have gone, and he's lost.
I didn't have any once, and the devils came in.
They drove me to try haschisch.

Women's a regrettable hincident.
She came down by the same train as I did.
You see, my ungovernable temper-- Your what?

You did the only thing possible.
The Cure will disappear from the face of the earth.

Clem Sypher's a jolly sight too good for her.
But I won't scratch you any more.

Besides, you need cheering up, little girl.
She was no girl to be lightly won, after all.
Don't you see you're not doing right?
It was a terrible experience to the girl.
She had never seen a man like this before.
Her hand rested lightly at her belt.
And what sort of a girl was she?
Perhaps she was escaping from justice.
Why do you run away from a woman?
She uses other weapons, he said.
She will never find you that way.
He is big and dark and handsome.
He wants me, and I ran away from him.
But where are your people, your family and friends?
You can't keep going like that.
O, and what was that her mother used to want?
I would rather die with wild beasts.
You would be better off with the beasts.
You make so few mistakes in your English.
He's your brother, ain't he, dearie?
Not an uncle nor cousin nor nothin?
You's a sweet, good girl; an he's a fine man.
You sure he ain't deceivin you, dearie?
I'm lonesome, an there's no women near by here.
The men would like to have a girl round.
I have just run away from a man, a dreadful one.
I don't like to see you go off with that man.
The message read: Your mother seriously ill.
It is not your custom where you come from.
You're made of iron and steel and precious stones.
If anything happened lo her, he would never know.
He walked back to his seat saying to himself, Fool!
You haven't wrote since your little girl was born.
I'd kind of like her to fill your place.
You look so tired, and I've some girls of my own.
You look strong, but you're kind of thin.
Your ma never was dark, ner your pa, neither.
There was no one left to care what I did.

It's all true, and you might's well face it.
They was all nice enough boys cept him.
If he said, Go, she went, no matter what I'd do.
I don't see why she sent another girl.
But I wish now I had stayed out there and died.
Don't you know that's a disrespectful way to speak?
You look like a rough boy with that on.
Why did you always be such a bad, bad boy?
Now I have told you everything, grandmother.
then after a minute: The impertinent fellow!
I mean to make him take me, anyway.
I'm just glad she's out of the way.
But first I must get you fixed up.
Your loving granddaughter, ELIZABETH.
You have not been changed nor spoiled.
And now I am coming to see you.
Don't you remember it, grandma?
I guess mebbe the dook wasn't rich enough.
Elizabeth was used to having people die.
I know you hate dinners and girls.
She was nothing to me after I saw you.
It's all perfectly throwed away on em.
You don't spose she's made a mistake, do you?
She was good to me once several years ago!
Life was mean, hard, small, selfish, and covetous.

[Exit John, L. 3 E.] Bud Dreadful low fellow, that.
Does she take me for an hangler?
I wonder if she takes me for an hangler?
Your affectionate brother, NED.
Dundreary, do you know what syllabubs are?
Dun That wath a joke, that wath.
Dun A whime is a widdle, you know.
Dun When it moves about, you know.
Geo [Fanning herself] Thank you, my lord.
Dun Why, that wath a joke, that wath.
Sir E Nonsense, Florence, impossible.
Sir E Florence, you are ridiculous.
[Aside.] Curse him, I wish I could!
Ver Tomahawks and scalping knives.
He will never harm you while Dundreary is about.
Why, he could get three scalps here.
Aug [Romantically.] Your American cousin.
What an all-fired chap you are.
The wed indians want to scalp me.
Aug He's not at all romantic, is he, mamma?
I reckon you know what that is.
Asa I'm as dry as a sap-tree in August.
Dun Why, does he want Mary to slap Jack?
Dun Pork's been here, but he's left.
[To Binny] Here, Puffy, just shake that up, faster.
Sir E That, sir, is your business.
Tis like the silly security of the Trenchard's.
Bin Will you take a baath before you dress?
Bin Just ring the bell, hi'll hattend you.
No use their talking Dutch to me.
Dun [Business.] Bud Your lordship!!
Dun If you don't find it, I'll discharge you.
Georgina No, thank you, my lord.
Geo Yes, my lord, you are always right.
Dun Do you know I'm getting to be very robust?
Geo I can't my lord, I'm _so_ delicate.
Geo No, my lord, I'm too delicate.
Geo No, my lord, it's too strong for me.
I am harmless except to my self.
You will then see if I speak truth or not.
Flo You here, sir, and listening.
Flo Well, cousin, what do you think of her?
Asa Ain't she a regular snorter?
Asa Wal, din't he drop like a smoked possum?
Flo There you go, more American.
Dun A cow growing out of his head?
Dun Does your brother like cheese?
Dun She's so delicate, she hasn't got a brother.
[Exit into dairy.] Geo [Jumps up.] Oh!
Dun Yes, you're very troublesome, you are.
Dun I wonder what the devil that is?
I don't mean that, he'll cure you.
Asa Wal, if you're cured I want to stay sick.
Your whiskers at this moment-- Dun My whiskers!
Asa Now, look here, you get the Lieut.
Flo I am going to crown you Capt.
Will you excuse my lighting a cigar?
Flo Then he lighted his cigar with 80,000 pounds.
Aug What would you advise, mamma?
I can't stand it, if you do, I'll bust.
Asa Don't know the manners of good society, eh?
you impudent--you unceremonious, oh!
I know it, I ain't so modest, but that I know it.
Asa [To Murcott.] Is he tight yet?
oh, you shall dearly pay for this.
Mr. Murcott, you saved me; may Heaven bless you.
[Aside to them.] Oh, you couple of fools.
Dun When I say wight I mean black.
Geo Please don't, Mr. Trenchard, I'm so delicate.
Asa Oh, you get out, I mean the old lady.
They turn and bunk foreheads.] Say, Mr. Puffy.
Binny You need not--not if you don't like unto.
Flo Why, you ungrateful fellow.

You know you've been simply crazy to get here.
I'll tell him---- Indeed, you'll do no such thing!
You don't mean I'm not to look at anyone!
You'll want me to wear a muzzle next.
I was looking for you in the modeling room.
She's monitor and I will say she enjoys the job.
I'm tired of your deceptive timidity.
she asked in smooth and oily tones.
No end younger than I am
I'll meet you at the Academy, Squibs.
You always hit the nail on the head, old lady.
I'll go look up my sister and tell her, she said.
Aren't you coming in to see Naskowski's lion-tamer?
I can't, usually, she said, gayly.
I can't stand any more palaver.
She isn't pretty, and it makes up to her for that.
I'll skirmish for laggards and report.
They're doing it brown this time!
She was a corker, I can tell you.
She was a wild one, I can tell you.
She'll say she's too green, I suppose.
Don't be stingy, Kendall Minor; tune up!
Fie, fie, my child; likewise, go to.

You'll have the treat of your young life then!
Don't know, replied Patricia gayly.
What in the world made you so disagreeable?
I didn't know you ever got so daffy over anything.
You two geniuses understand each other, I see.

He looks mild, but you want to watch him.
Shades of Hannah Ann defend us!
Pretty smelly sort of a place, isn't it?
Did you see him looking at us, Frad?
I haven't the duds to do credit to such doings.
Tell me this minute, you aggravating thing!
Good thing we're done up good and tight.
She'll exercise the black art in earnest.
She's much too sweet for my taste.
You'll need an extra nap after all these fandangos.
My word, but you're a crafty young one!
Thinking Taught While You Wait.
I know them better than you do.
She's certainly the sweetest thing.
She's a stunning worker when she goes at it.
She looks awfully well, doesn't she?
You know she'd not do a thing like that!
Any fool knows that, replied Griffin gruffly.
You'll only make her ridiculous.
She doesn't know any better yet.
We are the same as when you left, sir.
No, you don't, young un, he said decisively.
You girls get your duds on while I settle up.
What is the matter with you today, Ju?

Poor thing, she's done it at last!
Judith Kendall, you're a little monster!
Maybe she's had it too easy, poor girl.

The day of the regeneration of Russia is at hand!
Are you ready to undergo your ordeal?
Tell me not of your plans, knave!
I loathe the very sight of that youth.
Are they not superior to your skin-covered tents?
The Count exclaimed, Inexplicable girl!
you have conquered for a time
Say not a word, Kruntz, nor rouse the other knaves.
Is this all you found upon him, knave, eh?
this information is worth a princedom to me!
Now that I have you with me, loved one!
When you reach your native land, oh!
and henceforth, let me see your face no more.
While here, he would, you know, be in safety.
has any one lately left this mansion of yours?
I arrest you in the name of the Czar.
Either let me go free, or take the consequences.
I am your prisoner if you wish.
you could not do the vile deed.
She would have doubly hated you.
The women are still more wretched and squalid.
This good company is going with me, and by Allah!
Allah be praised for all his mercies!
Now tell me, what think you of my countrymen?
Tell them to come on
such words I spit upon
May the blessings of Allah attend you, my sons!
Now Heaven protect you, my sons!
Stay, Buda, stay; it is useless.
Saddle me a steed, knaves--haste, fly.

Would you have me turn traitor to my country?
Now hear me, General of the Moscov.
I cannot trust your countrymen.
Russian, speak you the words of truth?
I spit at you--I laugh at your threats.
His shallow grave was dug beneath his feet.
May curses rest on the traitor's head!
Whither go you so fast, Armenian?
Are you hastening to visit your friends the Urus?
Think you to elude our vigilance?
Why went you to the camp of our enemies?
Thus, let all spies and traitors die!
You have a hard life of it here, I suspect.
What want you with me, Armenian?
we will make his fears come true.
You must be prepared for the worst.
And now, chiefs, in the name of Allah!
