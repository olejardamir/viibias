That was the very question, said the man in black, which the ancient British clergy asked of Austin Monk, after they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own inability.
It's a pity, said I, that the British clergy at that interview with Austin, did not bring forward a blind Welshman, and ask the monk to operate upon him.
I am now a missionary priest labouring in heretic England, like Parsons and Garnet of old, save and except that, unlike them, I run no danger, for the times are changed.
said she, angrily, you are no sister of mine, you are a grasni {32}--a regular mare--a pretty sister, indeed, ashamed of your own language.
It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a fist, said Mr. Petulengro; that is, if the look comes from a woman, not that I am disposed to doubt that this female gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or the other.
You are very beautiful, madam, and I think you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have a great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair; I have a less regard for people with dark hair and complexions, madam.

And so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the night; on the morrow we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the porker.
Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found that it was sweet and tasty, which balluva {47b} that is drabbed can hardly be expected to be.
I see, said I, and at your merry meetings you sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people, alias their villainous actions; and after all, what would the stirring poetry of any nation be, but for its compulsatory deeds?
I think, brother, as I before said, that occasionally you utter a word of common-sense; you were talking of the Scotch, brother; what do you think of a Scotchman finding fault with Romany?
We know very little about ourselves, and you know nothing, save what we have told you; and we have now and then told you things about us which are not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you brother.
We know that already, brother; the constables and justices have contrived to knock that tolerably into our heads.
and the voices of our chies with their cukkerin {59a} and dukkerin {59b} don't help to make them pleasant?
Oh, I never troubled my head about your wife; but I suppose there have been love affairs between gorgios and Romany chies.
If they follows me, I tries to baffle them, by means of jests and laughter; and if they persist, I uses bad and terrible language, of which I have plenty in store.
You say that for a Romany chi to do what is unseemly with a gorgio, is quite out of the question, yet only the other day I heard you singing a song in which a Romany chi confesses herself to be cambri {71a} by a grand gorgious gentleman.
Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi, unless compelled by hard necessity, would have anything to do with a gorgio?
We are not over fond of gorgios, brother, and we hates basket-makers, and folks that live in caravans.
Don't think I am going to tell you all my history, brother; and, to tell you the truth, I am tired of sitting under hedges with you, talking nonsense.
Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he kicked and beat me, and drove me out to tell dukkerin when I could scarcely stand, he was not a bad husband.
A man, by gypsy law, brother, is allowed to kick and beat his wife, and to bury her alive, if he thinks proper.
I say, brother, let me tell you your dukkerin, with respect to her, you will never-- I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.
You call him lazy; you would not think him lazy if you were in a ring with him; he is a proper man with his hands.
I tell you what, brother, if ever gypsyism breaks up, it will be owing to our chies having been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentility.
I shall not use a similar deceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate me--so get up, Belle, and I will do my best to fling you down.
An animal like that is not intended for a little hare like me, but for some grand gentleman like yourself.
Well, said the landlord, for the sport of the thing I consent, so let your white pal get down, and your black pal mount as soon as he pleases.
if I had always such a nice attentive person to listen to me as you are, I could go on talking about orses to the end of time.
I say, partner, I am a poor postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a good mind to fling it in his face.
And thereupon, remembering that he had threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter upon his own.
My good friend, you must surely be light-headed; allow me to feel your pulse, and he attempted to feel my left wrist.

The Rysckie Tsar will lead his people forth, all the Sclavonians will join him, he will conquer all before him.
Tzernebock was no god of the Saxons, but one of the gods of the Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.

One day he favoured Popery; the next, on hearing certain clamours of the people, he sent his wife's domestics back packing to France, because they were Papists.
CHAPTER VII--SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED Now what could have induced Scott to write novels tending to make people Papists and Jacobites, and in love with arbitrary power?

Is not every Scotchman descended from some king, kemp, or cow-stealer of old, by his own account at least?
In order to get the Whigs into power, and themselves places, they brought the country by their inflammatory language to the verge of a revolution, and were the cause that many perished on the scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and newspaper articles they caused the Bristol conflagration, for which six poor creatures were executed; they encouraged the mob to pillage, pull down and burn, and then rushing into garrets looked on.

_Prisoner._ You steal my husband, and because I would do my best to stop you, when the men were afraid to attack and offered you food instead, you call me names.
Added to this, every woman remaining upon a farm was of the nature of an intelligence agent, and after the women had been removed, for the most part to the concentration camps, the majority of Kaffir kraals served the same purpose.
It then moved away, as well, and Ahmed was only one carlength away from where he could aim his fake taxi up the ramp at the doors.
Jamal -- his radio transmitter momentarily forgotten -- made a grab for his Beretta 9mm pistol in his right coat pocket.
Momentarily stunned, Mohammed Jamal fought to remain conscious and stared upward, trying to locate the Crown Victoria.
Jamal cast the pistol aside in frustration and dropped his right hand over his left to help it close on the transmitter even as more bullets tore through his chest and skull.
A pinch of the clay-like plastique came away between her fingers and she let it fall under the car before retrieving the bit of pipe and standing up.
The guy was a good team leader, but Mandi had overheard him talking to John Hartmann about one of his dates.
Cade followed at a slight distance, the better to eyeball her backside and legs as she marched ahead.
If you don't knock it off, I can tell your mom what a wonderful little gentleman you weren't at DragonCon.
They set forth toward the Orchid Ballroom as Cade said, Most men never grow out of that stage, you know.
A man on each side of the bed held a pistol aimed at each woman's head and Marjeel held a black Beretta 9mm pistol aimed generally between Mandi and Cade.
They landed hard, both of Cade's knees tightly together in the center of Marjeel's stomach as his back hit the floor.
Marjeel tried a rather inept left-handed punch at Cade, so Cade swatted him in the temple with the Beretta to calm him down.
The black and blue colors of Mandi's Kevlar jacket and dress seemed to stretch across the room to the first gunman and continued streaking across the bed to the second gunman.
Both men fell to the floor at about the same time and the blur came to a stop by the men struggling on the floor.
He turned from the screen and went to the bathroom, took a leak and washed Marjeel's taint from his hands, then combed his hair and headed back out to the bedroom.
Make Mandi Steele-wannabes all over the place and give her a nationwide crowd to get lost in; otherwise she'll have to hide between missions in order to have any privacy at all.
A fortyish blonde booth attendant rapped the pommel of one of the daggers from her display on her table and said, Don't make me call security, boys.
You're also a very beautiful woman and I expect you have all the usual feelings that come with being a female human being.
You'd just survived a major explosion, so it didn't seem likely that bullets would slow you down much, and all the guns were pointed at me at the time anyway.
Cade glanced from her legs to the table to try to see why she was taking so long just as Mandi turned to look grinningly back at him.
Does that mean I'd have to behave myself or that you'd have your way with me and then discard me like a used paper towel in the morning?
Her gaze still narrow, but now because she suspected Cade was teasing her, Mandi said, Try demonstrating.
Kissing her softly, he took his time about letting his lips brushingly caress hers, then made the kiss become a firm connection for some moments.
Setting the bottle down on the desk, Cade kicked off his boots and skinned out of his clothes, then grabbed the bottle and followed her.
Mandi grinningly stood still or moved as directed to allow him best-possible access with the shampoo and soap as Cade took his sweet time about washing her.
Sliding out from between her legs, Cade stood up and simply held her for a time as the spray cascaded over them both.
Mandi moved into his arms for a long, firm kiss, then she stepped back and said, If I can, I'll be back tonight.
He couldn't remember reading anything about pheromones having any particular smell, but Mandi wasn't exactly a Jane Average woman, either.
greeted him from people seated just beyond the door, but he ignored them as he re-closed the door and kicked the door stops down.
Only for you, ma'am, he said, putting the towel back over his eyes as he chuckled and repeated, Only for you.
At the end of the hedges a loud rustling sounded as a guy in his twenties jumped in front of them and said, Gimme your money, as he aimed a stiletto at them.
The combined might of an army might not be enough to take you down, but I'm not going to be quite that powerful, am I?
Feinting toward the Glock with his left hand to distract the guy's attention, Cade ducked slightly and swatted the Taurus upward with his right hand as he turned his feinting left into a jab at the guy's eyes.
Grabbing the guy's gun hand, he twisted it downward and back so the Taurus pointed at the guy's chest.
One of the others suddenly jumped into the car's driver's seat, but Cade pointed his Glock at the guy's face and said, No, not yet.
Checking out a green windbreaker, Cade said, That's just your own, personal, heavily biased opinion, ma'am.
He let his eyes roam her figure for a moment, then added, But only if they're worth it, Beth, and yours are definitely worth it.
Opening the door for her, Cade asked, So I'm just some poor, susceptible schmuck you're tapping for a meal, huh?
Or would it be Beth, specifically because Cade had built up her confidence enough to ask him up to her room?
He'd find reasons to compliment her and make her realize the truth of them until she decided absolutely about bedding him.
Leading her back to the desk, Cade handed Beth her open wine and openly admired her as she took a long sip of it.
Either there already were more or there would be more convertees reasonably soon, and about half of them would be female unless Mandi planned to spend a great deal of her time servicing all her male convertees herself.
If that's an indication of your progress, you'll be able to stop a tank round with your bare hands in a week.
Kissing her, Cade said, Thanks, milady, but you're still too young and beautiful to settle for less than you deserve.
The heavy line smashed through the wooden stave and hit Cade's chest like a baseball bat, knocking him flat and slapping him twice more across the chest and legs.
As he picked up his coffee and moved to sit on the bed, bolts of agony coursed through his shins and thighs.
Her reaction made Cade turn to see himself in the mirror and he saw the bruising that covered nearly all of his chest.
Grinning, Andrea sipped her drink and simply gazed at Cade for some moments, then asked, You really brought her off all by yourself?
He thumbed toward the bathroom and added, See you in a while, unless you want to come get wet with me.
Royal roads are the ways that kings travel, and kings are mostly dull fellows, and rarely have a good time.
The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies.
The administration of the War Department by papa Pache had been a masterpiece of imbecile knavery which infuriated Dumouriez and his half-starving troops.
The backwardness of the Prussians in supporting Coburg does not deter him from ordering to Flanders all the available British and mercenary troops, in order to besiege Dunkirk, and otherwise help the Imperialists.
But cease, ye fleecing Senators Your country to undo, Or know, we British _sans-culottes_ Hereafter may fleece you.
For of what use was it to move 60,000 Prussians more than 100 miles to defend West Flanders when that province was lost?
Christendom had vanished amidst the schemes of the monarchs in the East, and under the stabs of regicides in the West.
Moore was left as governor of the island, but with a garrison insufficient to complete the subjection of the fanatical blacks.
In that case the transfer of Hayti to England would have placed at her disposal myriads of devoted blacks, ready and able to plant the Union Jack on every fortress in the West Indies, and to conquer the colonies of Spain if she changed sides.
There, it continued, you would meet only with men enervated by luxury, soft beings that would tremble before the soldiers of liberty.
A personal appeal to the crew of the Royal George had no effect; and when Gardner vehemently reproached the men for skulking from the French, they ran at him; and he would have fared badly had he not placed his neck in a noose of a yard-rope and called on the men to hang him provided they returned to duty.
I believe the lower ranks heartily hate the gentlemen because they oppress them, and the gentlemen hate the peasants because they know they deserve to be hated.
On 9th May Beresford states that it would be a good plan to seize a number of malcontents, threaten them with flogging and induce them to turn informers.
The fact that Bonaparte had some time previously engaged Arab interpreters might surely have enlightened an agent of average intelligence.
Gordon, the most impartial historian of the rebellion, admits that the floggings and half-hangings had been few in number, yet he adds that the people were determined to revolt, probably from fear that their turn would come.
By the Treaty of Teschen (1779) Russia became one of the guarantors of the Germanic System which the French now set at naught.

Burning towns and churches, and everything in their path, they fortified themselves in the above-mentioned sites.

With this device, they have communication with their wives, and are unable to withdraw until a long time after copulation.
In matters of religion, the natives proceeded more barbarously and with greater blindness than in all the rest.
Very great annoyances result from this; for, not only can there be little security to the country with so many infidels, but the Sangleys are a wicked and vicious race.
But few of them turn out well, for they are a vile and restless race, with many vices and bad customs.
They are phlegmatic, of little courage, treacherous and cruel when opportunity offers, and very covetous.
The women are light-complexioned and beautiful, while the men have a complexion somewhat darker than a quince.

In the slaughter of Don Luis Dasmarinas and his men which soon follows, over thirty Spaniards manage to escape.
Finally, because we Spaniards always justify our causes, and we pride ourselves on the fact that no one in the world can say that we usurp other men's possessions or make war on our friends, all that is herein promised will be fulfilled.
When that report reached the Indians ears, it did so great harm that they began to rebel, especially in the provinces of Camarines and Pintados.

Morga's words prove true not only of the Indian, but also of the mestizos, the Spaniards, and even of various religious.
The operation has no religious significance, nor is it done for cleanliness, but from custom and disinclination to be ridiculed, probably [as Morga proves] having been learned from the Moros.
It is fabricated solely by native Indians in many parts of the Philippines, but especially in Ilo-Ilo.

My temper bubbled up like the carbonic acid gas in a chemical experiment, and my fists involuntarily clenched.
You're too young, but they want officers badly, and you'll soon get older, and I have no doubt will make a good soldier, if you command your temper.
There, you don't want me, he continued, as he felt my pulse, and then laid his hand upon my forehead.

You have forced me by your treatment to turn at last, and tell you that I will submit to your insults no longer, neither will I allow you to annoy Vincent.

I've had a nap too, and you've been breathing pretty hard, but not snorting and gurgling like that old wretch.
If you talk nonsense like that to me, sir, cried the doctor, I'll give you the nastiest dose you ever had in your life.
I may be wrong, but I believe that they've been plotting all this for years, and now the fire has begun, it's running all through the country, and unless the English look sharp, the land of India is gone for ever.
Yes, I think he is faithful; but he belongs to another people, and if he thinks that his people are about to get the upper hand, it is too much to expect him to stand fast by an alien race.
If we shut ourselves up, we are crippling a dashing troop of artillery; and, worse still, letting the scoundrels think they are our masters.

And by that time the skin was empty, hanging flaccid and collapsed upon the bheestie's back, as he went slowly out by the guarded gate, still bent down as if the load was heavy even yet.
But the moments glided by, and he still did not move, my suspense, in both senses of the word, being brought to an end by Dost lowering me down quickly.
I only stand in your way when I see that, in a blind madness, you are going to rush headlong to destruction.
Half my defenders were down, the others had dropped from the windows in spite of the depth, and two men with levelled bayonets dashed at me.

In the next place, these accusers are numerous, and have accused me now for a long time; moreover, they said these things to you at that time of life in which you were most credulous, when you were boys and some of you youths, and they accused me altogether in my absence, when there was no one to defend me.

It is clear, therefore, from these messengers, that it will come to day, and consequently it will be necessary, Socrates, for you to die to-morrow.
For, he said, the Eleven are now freeing Socrates from his bonds, and announcing to him that he must die to-day.
For as many as rightly apply themselves to philosophy seem to have left all others in ignorance, that they aim at nothing else than to die and be dead.

This is not properly atheism, but a sort of anti-religion prescribed by the Devil, and which an atheist of common sense would scorn as an absurdity.
This being maturely considered by these lovers of the Church, they endeavoured to propagate as many heresies as they could, that the light of truth might shine the clearer.

Would the Dissenters join in alliance with them likewise, because they agree already in some general principles, and because the Jews are allowed to be a stiffnecked and rebellious people?
They have many weak, defenceless parts, they have not been used to a regular attack, and therefore it is that they are so ill able to endure one, when it comes to be their turn.
So that they complain more of a few months truths from us, than we did of all their scandal and malice, for twice as many years.
You will have to cut off my head, said he, with a vicious countenance, or, rather, I will cut off yours, before I let you go another step.
Our experience had taught us that it was better to treat Tibetan officials as inferiors, as they were then more subdued and easier to deal with.
Let me offer you these boots, so that your feet may not get sore on the long and difficult journey back to your native land.
But every man in Tibet is so cowardly that the lesson would have to be constantly repeated, answered Wilson, with his unfailing wisdom.
Bijesing, the Johari, and Rubso, the Christian cook, were the first to enter into an open fight with them.
I slowly got up, rifle in hand, and as I raised my head above the wall I found myself face to face with the man on the other side.
I repressed my anger on remembering that, according to their religion, the fact of being at Mansarowar absolved them from all sins.
The Lamas mistook me for a Hindoo doctor, owing to the color of my face, which was sunburnt, and had long remained unwashed.
The Tibetans are a deeply devout race, and the Lamas are not backward in extorting money, under pretences of all kinds, from the ignorant worshippers.
To this power are due the frequent reports of apparitions of Buddha, seen generally by single individuals, and the visions of demons, the accounts of which terrify the simple-minded natives.
The nuns, most unattractive in themselves, shave their heads, and practise witchcraft and magic, just as the Lamas do.
Chakzal!_ (We salute you, king!) I felt anything but regal after the wretched night we had spent, but I wished to treat the natives with due deference and politeness whenever it was possible.
Then, angrily said a young and powerful Tibetan, if you continue your journey, we will take back our gifts.
Their cries of distress, caused by fear alone, for we had done them no real harm, served to strengthen the contempt in which my men by now held the Tibetan soldiers and their officers.
I unslung my rifle, and would have fired at them had the threat alone not been sufficient to make them reflect.
I am only a messenger, he hastened to state, and therefore do not pour your anger upon me if I speak to you.
We expected the soldiers to attack us during the night to try and stop our progress, but all was quiet and nothing happened.
_Kiu mahla lokhna nga rah luck tiba tangan_ (I will give you a goat or a sheep if you will go back), he said.
The Tibetans had so far behaved with such contemptible cowardice that we could hardly congratulate ourselves on such easy successes.
FOOTNOTES: [Footnote 9: Religious fanatics.] CHAPTER XVIII CAPTURED In the night I heard noises several times.
Each time I got one hand or leg free from their clutches, I hit right and left at any part where I could disable my opponents.
Then they tied my wrists tightly behind my back; they bound my elbows, my chest, my neck, and my ankles.
The Rupun, stooping low, and making pretence to tuck in the blanket, whispered: Your head is to be cut off to-morrow.
This they did, after making my bonds tighter than ever, and placing extra ropes round my chest and arms.
They made me lay flat on my face on the ground, and held me down firmly while they unwound the ropes from around my wrists.
My position was not enviable, as I stood with my legs wide apart, with my back, hands, and legs bleeding, and my sight injured.
The tantalizing failure of every attempt they made to hurt me drove the crowd to the highest pitch of fury.
Then he strode toward me with slow, ponderous steps, swinging the shiny, sharp blade from side to side, with his bare arms outstretched.
He told me that, when I had called him, a Lama had placed his hand upon his mouth to prevent him from answering, while, with the other hand, the Lama had squeezed his neck so tightly as to nearly strangle him.
Upon application the Tibetans revolved the wooden bowl round and round my mouth, and I licked it as clean as if it had never been used.
In the meanwhile, protected by the darkness of the stormy night, I had succeeded in replacing my hand inside the iron handcuff.
The rifle, flying out of his hands, described a somersault in the air, and the Lama fell backward to the ground, where he remained spread out flat, bleeding all over, and screaming like a child.
The injured Lama was the one at the head of the party that wanted to have my head cut off, so, naturally enough, I could not help betraying my satisfaction at the accident.
As the ropes round my ankles were unwound from the deep channels they had cut into my flesh, large patches of skin came away with them.
A number of Lamas were still anxious to have us beheaded, whereas the Pombo and the others had the previous night almost made up their minds to send us back to the frontier.
After certain incantations, the oracle answered that I must be beheaded or the country would be in great danger.
Poor Mansing was made to walk, and was beaten mercilessly when, tired and worn, he fell or remained behind.
It was at that moment that we three semi-corpses collected what little strength remained in us, and suddenly, with what stones we could pick up, made an attack on the soldiers.
He asked for a few minutes respite, but was jeeringly told by his guards that it was superfluous, as he was to be beheaded in a few minutes.
The _Pombo_ next took a matchlock, which he rested on his victim's forehead and then discharged upward.
After this tragic performance Mr. Landor was thrown to the ground and a cloth put over his head and face to prevent his seeing what was being done to his servant Mansing.
My guards informed me my master was to be decapitated at Galshio, and that I was to be beheaded where I was.
He was handcuffed with enormous cuffs, clothes torn to rags, bleeding from his waist, feet and hands swollen.

My uncle wants to do a good business, whether in the gross joys of the flesh or in the benefits of salvation.
I wonder whether this myopia of my uncle is due to the fact that he is a confirmed old bachelor, and all women and children are to him pure ideals, as much sweeter than all other ideals as they are more substantial?
He has measured himself with boys, he knows their code and feels the spur of their ideals of achievement.

Which tells the secret that you have some sort of human fondness for the lifeless bundle of rags, said Mr. John, and proves what I feared, that you are a very weak-minded little girl, Mollie.
